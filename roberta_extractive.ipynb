The contention of the respondent was that the contract notes actually issued were not in accordance with the bye- laws of the Association and were accordingly void under Section 8 of the Bombay Cotton Contracts Act, 1932, and that, that being so, the arbitration agreement incorporated in the contract note was also void and there could be no reference to arbitration and there could be no award as purported to have been made by the arbitrators on a refer- ence under the void contracts. The contention of the Respondent has been and is that by reason of the omission of the two clauses at the end of the contract note actually issued by the Appellants it was not in accordance with the bye-laws.',\n",
       " 'This is an application under article 32 of the Constitu- tion of India made by Rashid Ahmed for enforcement of his fundamental right to carry on his business which is said to have been completely stopped by the respondent, the Munici- pal Board of Kairana. to the petitioner. \"You are hereby informed that the Municipal Board, Kairana, have given the contract of wholesale purchase and sale of the vegetables, which is in force from the 1st day of January, 1950. The second part of this bye-law clearly contem- plates that everybody will be entitled to do business at the place fixed by the respondent Board, but as a result of a monopoly in favour of the contractor Habib Ahmad having been created, nobody else can do business at that place as conceded by the learned Advocate for the respondent Board. It\\' is conceded that the rejection of the petitioner\\'s application was not based on any such ground but that it was because there was no bye-law authorising the issue of any license.',\n",
       " \"749 The sole point for determination in the appeal is wheth- er a widow in possession of her husband's estate in lieu of her claim for dower with the consent of the other heirs or otherwise is entitled to priority as against his other unsecured creditors. The learned advocate for the appellant contends that a widow's claim for outstanding dower even when she is in possession of her husband's estate in lieu of her claim with the consent of other heirs of the deceased stands on no better footing than that of unsecured creditors, though in their absence she is entitled to be paid in full before the estate is distributed among the heirs. It seems clear that unless the husband by his own act has placed the widow in a better position than his other creditors, her claim for dower is in the nature of an unsecured debt and she has no priority of any kind against the other unsecured creditors of her husband. The dower of a Muslim woman is a settlement in her favour made prior to the marriage contract and is similar to the donatio propier nuptias of the Romans but is of such an obligatory nature that if it is not mentioned before or at the time of the marriage, it is presumed to exist to the extent of a proper dower amount. 295 Mr. Mulla in his book on Muhammadan Law has adopted the view that dower ranks as a debt and that the widow is entitled along with other creditors to have it satisfied out of the estate and that her right is not greater than that of any other creditor.\",\n",
       " 'This objection was overruled by the court and it was held that under the provi- sions of section 42 of the Co-operative Credit Societies Act the Registrar retained the power of staying execution of the award decree even after the issue of a certificate by him. This section is in these terms :- \"If an award given by the Registrar or by a person nominated by him, or by a committee of arbitrators is not acted upon, then the Registrar can have it enforced- (a) through a civil court on a certificate issued by him. It has been held that the first appellate court was in error in the view that the default clause in the decree stood condoned by the payment of the first instalment by the judgment- debtor in the office of the Registrar and it has been positively found that once a default has been made the Registrar had no jurisdiction to condone it and that the decree-holder was entitled to execute the decree for the full decretal amount with interest. The logical result of the High Court\\'s decision is that the certificate stands and the execution application has been properly made and the decree-holder is entitled to the relief claimed but in spite of it it has been held 747 that the Registrar can stay the proceedings. As a fresh certificate was issued by the Nazim in order to cure a defect that might be said to exist in the original certificate because of its having been sent by the Madadgar Nazim, it is unnecessary to consider the contention of the learned counsel that there was no proper certificate in this case and the proceedings in execution therefore were without jurisdiction.',\n",

Under article 374 (4) on and from the com- mencement of this Constitution the jurisdiction of the authority functioning as the Privy Council in a State speci- fied in Part B to the First Schedule to entertain and dis- pose of appeals and petitions from or in respect of any judgment, decree or order of any court within that State ceased, and all appeals and other proceedings pending before the said authority at such commencement stand transferred to and have to be disposed of by the Supreme Court. Under article 134, it is provided that an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, final order or sentence in a criminal proceed- ing of a High Court in the territory of India if the High Court......... (then follow three contingencies under which such appeals can lie), In article 133 also the words \"in the territory of India\" are used. The\\' question for consideratioh is whether on the facts of the present case the Supreme Court can grant special leave to appeal from a judgment, sentence or order which was passed and made by the Hyderabad High Court before 26th January, 1950. In our opinion this Court has therefore no jurisdiction to entertain these petitions for special leave to appeal against such judgments of the High Court of Hyderabad under Article 136 of the Constitution.',\n",
       " \"--This appeal is on behalf of the plaintiff and it arises out of a suit for specific performance of a contract to sell a house in the town of Gaya, belonging to the defendants second party who, it is alleged, agreed to sell the house to the plaintiff but subsequently resiled from the agreement and sold the same to the defendants first party who purchased it with notice of the contract. The Subordinate Judge, who heard the suit, came to the conclusion, on the evidence adduced by the parties, that the story of a contract of sale, as alleged by the plaintiff, was not established and it was not in pursuance of any such contract that the plaintiff was put in possession of the house. 30,000 to the defendants second party, but this was by way of a loan and not as part payment of the consideration money. It is true that it was no part of the plaintiff's case as made in the plaint that 282 the sum of Rs. 284 The result is that we allow the appeal in part; the decree made by the High Court is affirmed in so far as it dismissed the claim for specific performance- The plaintiff, however, will be entitled to a money decree for the sum of Rs.\",\n",
       " \"The Subordinate Judge held that even the land in Pattar Kalan was not shown to be ancestral by the evidence adduced on the side of plaintiff, as it was found that the common ancestor, Sehja Singh, had not only two sons called Jodha Singh and Jai Singh, but a third son named Pohlo, and that from the mere fact that the two sons enjoyed the land in equal shares, no presumption could arise that the property was ancestral and descended by inheritance from the common ancestor, when nothing was known about the share of the third son. The document he wanted to be taken on record and considered, and of which it was alleged that he was not aware at the trial, was a kami beshi statement relating' to Mauza Pattar Kalam, which contained a note that the third son, Pohlo, gave up his interest in the ancestral property in favour of his brothers. On the basis of these findings, he decreed the plaintiff's suit in its entirety, including the lands in the village of Kadduwal which were conceded to be nonancestral and also an area of 4 bighas and 16 biswas of land in Pattar Kalan which, accord- ing to the record of rights, was not in the possession of Jodha Singh and Jai Singh, but with third parties. It was strenuously argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that it was not open to the High Court to inter- fere with the discretion exercised by the District Judge in allowing additional evidence to be adduced and that even assuming that there was an erroneous finding of fact, it must stand final as a second appeal can be entertained only on the specific grounds mentioned in section 100 of the Civil Procedure Code. In the present case, there is nothing to show that there was any lacuna or gap which had to be filled up and that the appellate court felt the need for the omission being sup- plied so that it could pronounce a judgment; to put it the other way round, it does not appear, and it was not stated, that the District Judge felt himself unable to come to a decision without copies of the settlement registers that were sought to be put in before him for the first time.\",\n",
       " 'The appellant\\'s main defence was that on a proper con- struction of s. 3 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, hereinafter referred to as the Act) it was not competent for the Government to pass the order of 5th December, 1947, which was consequently illegal and void, and that obstruction to the execution of that order could not constitute an offence under s. 186 of the Indian Penal Code. It was contended that an order under sub-section (1) should be in the nature of a rule or regulation of general application, like the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1947, issued by the Central Government on 4th August, 1947, as the sub-section confers on the Central Government only the power to \"provide for regulating or prohibiting\" the production, supply, distribution, etc., of essential commodities, and does not authorise the making of ad hoc or special orders with respect to any particular person or thing. This delegation is expressed to be made \"in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 3 and 4\" of the Act, but unless the Central Government itself had the power of issuing such directions under section 3, it could not delegate that power to the Controller under section 4. In the present case, the order of 5th December, 1947, directing the seizure of 5,000 maunds of the company\\'s sugar, in the execution of which the appellant has been found to have obstructed the officers of the Pro- vincial Government, recited that the company was \"about to commit a contravention of the order of the Chief Controller of Prices and Supplies, Bihar, made under cl. Rule 26 of the Rules made under the section, however, authorised the Gov- ernment to detain a person \"if it is satisfied\" that it was necessary to detain him with a view to prevent him from acting prejudicially..\\' .....The Federal Court held (2) that this rule was ultra vires as it Went beyond the scope of clause (x) in that it left it to the satisfaction of the Government to decide whether or not it was necessary to detain a (1) [1945] F.

       " 'It is alleged by the plaintiff that the custom of Dhar Dhura could not create any title in the defendants, who are the proprietors of villages Jhawa Nagla and Gurganwan, to the disputed plot, which is to the north and west of the main current of the river as it flowed in the year 1340, as the custom applies only when the change in the deep stream is gradual and not sudden and it cannot have any possible application when the river leaves the three villages alto- gether and ceases to flow within them as has happened in the present case. Apart from the oral evidence that has been adduced in this case there are two Rubkaris of the Collectorate and one judgment by a Civil Court to all of which the predecessors of the parties to the present litigation were parties and they show clearly that demarca- tion of the lands of the three villages has always been made with reference to the position of the deep stream of the river at different times and it was regarded as immaterial whether the change in the stream happened gradually or all on a sudden. It is urged by the learned counsel for the appellants that such custom is unreasonable and should for that reason be held to be unenforceable in law. In the year 1341 Fasli the river suddenly changed its course and as it shift- ed to the north and west beyond the limits of mouza Sikha, the custom of Dhar Dhura would no longer govern the rights of the parties and the title to the plot of land, which is the subject matter of dispute, must be determined in accord- ance with the provisions of the Regulation itself. This position certainly has got to be admitted but as we are concerned with the state of affairs existing at the date of the institution of the suit and there is no evidence on the record as to the position of the river at the present moment, the plaintiff will be entitled to a decree in the form as it was given by the trial judge, it being clearly understood that the rights declared in this suit would be subject to the custom of Dhar Dhura which the defendants may invoke if and when the proper occasion arises.',\n",
       " 'In 1946, the appellant and his two employ- ees were tried before the Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Guntur in respect of offences under the Motor Spirit Ration- ing Order, 1941, and were convicted in each of the cases on the 18th July, 1946. The plea of the appellant before the Magistrate was that he was the presiding 1st Class Bench Magistrate at Chirala, that he was carrying on business in petrol at various centres through servants and he had issued instructions to them not to deviate from the rules under any circumstances and that he could not be made liable for transgression of the rules committed by his employees. The plea of the appellant that he was not present at 325 Guntur when the alleged offences were committed has not been negatived by the lower courts, but they have held that he was nevertheless liable, as the question of mens rea was not relevant to the offences with which the appellant was charged. The Privy Council ultimately upheld the conviction of the appellants on the merits but with regard to the view taken by the High Court that even if the first appellant was (1) I.L.R. Relying upon this rule, he held that where a servant sells petrol to a bogus customer in the absence of coupons m contravention of the Motor Spirit Rationing Order, and the master is not present at the time nor has he any knowledge of the supply of petrol by the servants to the bogus custom- er, the master cannot be held to be vicariously liable for the act of the servant.',\n",
       " 'The judgment of the Court was deliv- ered by KANIA C.J.--This is an appeal by special leave against an order of the Allahabad High Court dismissing the revision petition of the appellant against the order of the Special Magistrate refusing to quash the proceedings on the ground that the prosecution of the appellant inter alia under sections 161 and 165 of 314 the Indian Penal Code was illegal and without jurisdiction in the absence of the sanction of the Government under section 107 of the Criminal Procedure Code and section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption. On behalf of the appellant it is argued that when the warrant for his arrest was issued by the Magistrate on the 22nd of October, 1947, the Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and, as no sanction of the Government had been obtained before that day, the initiation of the proceedings against him, which began on that day without the sanction of the Government, was illegal. The order which may be applied for and made during the police investigation by virtue of section 3 of the Act is therefore before the Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offence under section 6 of the Act or section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Reading sections 197 and 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code and section 6 of the Act in the light of the wording of the proviso to section a, it is therefore clear that the stage at which a warrant is asked for under the proviso to section 3 of the Act is not on cognizance of the offence by the Magistrate as contemplated by the other three sections. The only question which is now presented for our decision therefore is whether there was any sanction granted by the Government before the Magistrate took cogni- zance of the offence and issued the notice under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code On the 25th March, 1949.',\n",
       " \"The second contention was that the deed of release operated as a sur- render of the widow's estate in favour of the daughter who was the next reversioner and although by such a surrender the daughter could get only a limited estate which she would have been entitled to on the death of the widow, yet as the daughter died in 1926, the present suit which was instituted more than 12 years after the date of death, was barred by limitation. 6)executed by the widow in favour of her daughter and son-in-law, the Subordinate Judge came to the conclusion that the deed operated as a surrender of the widow's estate and as the daughter died in 1926, the plaintiffs' suit was barred by limitation. His first contention is that the deed of 660 release (Exhibit P-6) executed by Chanchamma had the effect of a surrender of the widow's estate in favour of her daughter and son-in-law and the daughter having died in 1926, the plaintiffs' suit was barred by limitation. The lower appellate court held that the gift was a valid surrender, but this decision was reversed by the High Court on appeal and it was held that the transaction was not valid in law inasmuch as it was not a gift in favour of the daughter alone but in favour of her son-in-law as well who was to take jointly with the daughter. A rever- sioner's suit for recovery of possession of the property alienated by a widow, it is well settled, is governed by article 141 of the Limitation Act, and as it is not neces- sary that the transfer should be set aside before any decree for possession is made, all that is necessary is that the reversioner should file a suit for possession within 12 years from the death of the widow and a decree passed in such a suit must be on the basis that the possession of the transferee was unlawful ever since the widow died.\",\n",
       " 'The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI.C.J.--This is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution for the enforcement of the petition- er\\'s fundamental rights under article 19 (1) (f) and article 31(1) alleged to have been violated by the Central Bank of India Ltd., a company incorporated under the Indian Compa- nies Act, 1882, and having its registered office at Bombay, (hereinafter referred to as \"the Bank\"). The language and structure of article 19 and its setting in Part III of the Constitution clearly show that the article was intended to protect those freedoms against State action other than in the legitimate exercise of its power to regu- late private rights in the public interest, 393 Violation of rights of property by individuals is not within the purview of the article. 36 of the State List and entry No, 42 of the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, he also argued that, while these entries read with article 246 empowered Parliament and the State Legislatures to make laws regarding acquisition or requisitioning of property for the purposes of the Union or the State as the case may be. Similarly, the words \"save by authority of law\" in clause (1) of article 31 show that it is a prohibition of unauthorised governmental action against private property, as there can be no question of one private individual being authorised by law to deprive anoth- er of his property. It is not correct to suggest that, merely be- cause there is no entry in the Lists of the Seventh Schedule relating to \"deprivation of property\" as such, it is not within the competence of the legislatures in the country to enact a law authorising deprivation of property.',\n",
       " 'The judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.---This appeal is on behalf of the defendant and it arises out of a suit, under section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code, commenced by the plaintiffs who were origi- nally nine in number in the court of the District Judge of Kaira at Nadiad. The defendant has now come up to this court on the strength of a certificate granted by the High Court; and though formally it is an appeal against the final decree made by the High Court on 14th of July, 1947, in substance it challenges the propriety of the order of remand passed on 24th January, 1938, by which the High Court reversed the decree of dismissal made by the District Judge and remanded the case, being of opinion that the properties in dispute did appertain to a public trust of a religious and charita- ble character. Mr. Daphtary appearing in support of the appeal has contended before us that on the question as to whether or not a public trust existed in respect of the properties in suit, the view taken by the trial judge was right and that the decision of the High Court is based upon a misapprecia- tion of the evidence on the record. A suit under section 92, Civil Procedure Code, is a suit of a special nature which presupposes the existence of a public trust of a religious or charitable character. The denial could not certainly oust the jurisdiction of the court, but when the courts found concurrently, on the evidence adduced by the parties, that the allegations of breach of trust were not made out, and as it was not the case of the plaintiffs, that any direction of the court was necessary for proper adminis- tration of the trust, the very foundation of a suit under section 92, Civil Procedure Code, became wanting and the plaintiffs had absolutely no cause of action for the suit they instituted.',\n",

Objections were taken on behalf of the defendant on the 17th April, 1923, and it was contended that the plaintiffs may be allowed mesne profits to the extent of the amount that would be found due after deduction of the amount of rent to which the defendant was entitled in re- spect of the lands in suit according to the judgment of the munsif. The District Judge on appeal by his judgment dated the 16th December, 1938, allowed the claim of equitable set-off for the period subsequent to delivery of possession and directed that \"from the plaintiffs dues, the dues of the defendant are to be deducted and if after these deduc- tions any sum is due to the plaintiffs they will get a decree for that sum. The claim for set-off for the period for which mesne profits were claimed has been allowed and is not in these appeals.',\n",
       " 'Being aggrieved by the order of the respondent dated the lath May, 1950, the appellants filed a petition in the High Court of the State of Punjab at Simla on the 26th February, 1951, under article 226 of the Constitution, praying for a writ of certiorari for quashing and setting aside that order and for a writ of prohibition or mandamus directing the said respondent to forbear from proceeding with the hearing of the said appeal on the 7th March, 1951, or on any other date or dates. The High Court held that the order of the respondent pronounced on the 15th May, 1950, was not a nullity and the appeal preferred by Tekehand was in effect and in substance an appeal from the order passed by the Additional Custodian on the 8th February, 1950, and that Tekchand was a person aggrieved within the meaning of section 24 of the Ordi- nance. That assuming that the appeal was preferred against the order of the 8th, that order was not an appealable order inasmuch as section 24 allows an appeal against an order declaring properties evacuee properties and not against any conclusion that a certain person is or is not an evacuee, and thus no appeal was Competent at all which could be heard by the respondent. The larger question that has been raised in the petition pending before the High Court of the State of Bombay that the properties of Aboobaker could not be declared evacuee properties after his death as they had devolved on his heirs was not raised in these proceedings and we have not been invited to decide it. It was contended that no appeal lay against the order of the Additional Custodian dated the 8th February declining to declare Aboobaker an evacuee, that the only order that the Custodian is entitled to pass under section 7 is an order declaring any property to be evacuee property and that it is this order and this order alone which is appealable under section 24.',\n",

The following facts, that Jaspal died, that his body was found in a trunk and was discovered from a well and that the appellant took part in the disposal of the body do not establish the cause of his death or the manner and circumstances in which it came about. Thereafter I said to Mohinderpal Singh that if he did not help me I would die., He got removed that box from my kothi with the help of my servants and placing the same in his jeep went to his store in Baldevnagar Camp and kept the same there. The result therefore is that no use can be made of the statement made by Palvinder and contained in the alleged confession and which the High Court thought was the most important piece of evidence in -the case to prove that the death of Jaspal was caused by poisoning or as a result of an offence having been committed.\",\n",

The facts in that case were that while there was a sanction of the Government for a prosecution under the Cotton Cloth and Yarn Control, Order, there was nothing in the sanction itself, or in the shape of extraneous evidence, to show that the sanction was accorded after the relevant facts were placed before the sanctioning authority. 133 was no such statutory provision as section 556 of the Code but, only the general rule of law that a man could not be judge in a case in which he had an interest, the facts were that a Sub-Registrar, who was also an Assistant Magistrate, having come to know in his official capacity as a registering officer that an offence under the Registration Act had been committed, sanctioned a prosecution, and subsequently tried the case himself. It is his duty, when he comes to know that an offence has been committed, to cause a prosecution to be instituted, by which I understand that there is prima facie evidence of an offence having been committed, that there is that which renders it proper that there should be ail enquiry, and the Registrar accordingly gives his sanction to it ; and certainly, I cannot suppose that, because an officer in his position sanctions the institution of a prosecution, his mind is made up as to the guilt of the party and .',\n",
       " 'It was granted on a ground which was not taken either in the original court or in the revision before the High Court, namely that the Essential Supplies Act of 1946 under which the appellant was convicted was not in force on the 24th of October, 1950, and-so there could be no conviction under it. This is the extension with which we are concerned and which is now challenged, the argument being that there was no legislative body in existence on that date competent to extend the life of the Act for another year. It was argued on behalf the appellant that because of this article the Constituent Assembly disappeared as a law making body on and after the 26th of November, 1949, and that its place was taken by the Provisional Parliament referred to by that article, and as the resolution of the 20th December, 1949, purports to be a resolution of the Constituent Assembly (Legislative) and not of the Provisional Parliament, it is a resolution of a body which no longer had authority to enact laws or pass a resolution of this kind affecting the laws of the land. The Provisional Parliament was not a body authorised to exercise the special power of approving the extension of the period mentioned in section 4 of the English statute as that was not one of \"the powers conferred by this Constitution on Parliament,\" nor can bringing the Provisional Parliament into existence on the 26th of November, 1949 650 ( assuming that to be the case) be regarded as other provision\" made by the Constituent Assembly within the meaning of section 4-A of the English Act.

       " 'The claim for ejectment of the defendants was founded on the allegation that the properties belonged to the temple, having been given to it by an Inam grant made in 1770 A.D. by Janganna Rao, the then Zamindar of Rachur, that the defendants I to 16 and their predecessors were Archakas rendering Nitya Naivedya Deeparadhana services and as such were in possession of the properties for and on behalf of the temple and that defendants 17 to 43 were the lessees under the Archakas and that the defendants I to 16 were wrongfully claiming the properties as their own and the other defendants claimed to be in possession of portions of the properties as their lessees. The only two points which were raised before us, as before the High Court, are (1) whether the Inam grant was made in favour of the temple or whether the grant was made in favour of the Archakas burdened with the duties of service, and (2) what right did the grant confer on the grantee-whether it was a grant of the land itself or only of the melvaram interest in the properties. In the copies of the Inam Register and Inam Statement filed in that case the Archakas were shown as the grantees and the present enjoyers of the Inam grant and the amount shown under the heading in column 2 of the Inam register as the assessment was the same as the amount shown under column 3 of the Inam Statement under the heading \"Income derived from Inam\". In the case before us the Archakas are nowhere mentioned in either Exhibit P/3 or in Exhibit D/3, there is no evidence that they had any title to kudivaram rights and finally the amount of assessment shown under column 7 of the Inam register, Exhibit P/3, is Rs. It follows, therefore, that no inference that the Inam -grant comprised only melvaram rights can be inferred from the fact that under column 7 only the amount of assessment is set out, and, therefore, the reasoning on which the decision relied on by the learned Attorney-General was founded cannot be supported as correct.',\n",
       " \"On the same day (21st August, 1952) the respondent applied to the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution contending that article 192 thereof was applicable only where a member became subject to a disqualification after he was elected but not where, as here, the disqualification arose long before the election, in which case the only remedy was to challenge the validity of the election before an Election Tribunal. It has been urged that, so far as civil matters are concerned, the more comprehensive provisions in article 133(1) (c) for the grant of a certificate of fitness for appeal to the Supreme Court completely overlap article 132(1) which relates only to one specific ground, namely, a substantial question of law being involved as to the interpretation of the Constitution, and that the court's power, therefore, to grant a certificate of fitness on any ground including the ground referred to above, must be deem- ed to arise under article 133(1) (c), with the result that the exercise of such power is excluded by the opening 1149 words of clause (3) of that article which bars an appeal from the judgment, decree or final order of one Judge of a High Court. Though there had been some conflict of judicial opinion on the point it was authoritatively decided by the Privy Council in the Parlakimedi case(1) that the High Court of Madras--the High Courts of Bombay and Calcutta were in the same position-had no power to issue what were known as high prerogative writs beyond the local limits of its original civil jurisdiction, and the power to issue such writs within those limits was derived by the court as successor of the Supreme Court which had been exercising jurisdiction over the Presidency Town of Madras and was replaced by the High Court established in pursuance of the Charter Act of 1861. It will thus be seen that the decision is no authority for dispensing with the necessity of the presence or location, within the local limits of the court's jurisdiction, of the person or authority to whom the writ is to be issued, as the basis of its power to issue it. As, however, we have held that the High Court was not competent under article 226 to issue any prerogative writ to the appellant Commission, the appeal is allowed and the writ of prohibition issued by the learned Judge is quashed.\",\n",
       " 'He held that on the facts stated in the complaint the only offence that could be said to have been committed by the appellants was one under section 182 or section 21 1, Indian Penal Code, and that a court was not competent to take cognizance of those offences except on a complaint by a proper authority under the provisions of section 195, Criminal Procedure Code. In respect of the conviction under 841 section 297, Indian Penal Code, the learned Judges said that there as nothing in sections 195 to 199, Criminal Procedure Code, which could in any way bar the prosecution of the appellants under that section, as it could in no way be said that it arose out of the facts which would constitute an offence under section 182, or section 211, Indian Penal Code. It was however argued that if on the same facts an 843 offence of which no cognizance can be taken under the provisions of section 195 is disclosed and the same facts disclose another offence as well which is outside the purview of the section and prosecution for that other offence is taken cognizance of without the requirements of section 195 having been fulfilled, then the provisions of that section would become nugatory and if such a course was permitted those provisions will stand defeated. Two distinct offences having been committed in the same transaction, one an offence of misappropriation under section 409 and the other an offence under section 477-A which required the sanction of the Governor, the cir- cumstance that cognizance could not be taken of the latter offence without such consent was not considered a bar to the trial of the appellant with respect to the offence under section 409. Leave to appeal under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution was limited to the question of law referred to the Full Bench in this case, and it was distinctly said in the order disposing of the leave petition that leave would not have been granted had the scope of the appeal been limited to the merits of the case.',\n",

If the committal proceeding is left out of account as not being compulsory, and its absence did not operate to take away the jurisdiction of the Special Judge to take cognizance of the case before the Constitution, the difference between a warrant procedure prescribed by the impugned Regulation to be followed by the Special Judge after such cognizance was taken and the sessions procedure at that stage applicable under the general law is not at all substantial, and the minor differences would not bring the case within the mischief of article 14 of the Constitution. 675 Qasim Razvi's case(1) while interpreting the decision in Lachmandas Kewalram Ahuja v. The State of Bombay(1) laid, down the principle that the mere fact that some of the provisions of the impugned Regulation are discriminatory on the face of it, is not sufficient to render the trial and the conviction void under article 14, read with article 13 (1) of the Constitution and that in such cases where the trial is continued after the 26th January, 1950, under the impugned Regulation, it is necessary to see whether the procedure followed after the material date was such as deprived the accused of the equal protection of laws within the meaning of article 14 of the Constitution and that if the accused under such procedure received substantially the benefits of the trial under the ordinary law, the trial and conviction cannot be held as void and illegal. 676 (1) that the Regulation excludes the committal proceedings, (2) that the procedure of the sessions trial is replaced by the warrant procedure, (3) that there is no right of transfer, (4) that there is no revision, (5) that the right of confirmation by the Nizam in case of sentences of death has been negatived. The only discriminatory feature of the Regulation left therefore is that no sentence of a Special Tribunal shall be subject to or submitted for confirmation by any authority whatsoever contained in section 7 (2) of Regulation V of 1358F which is made applicable,under section 8 of Regulation X of 1359 F., in other words, that the right of the Nizam to confirm the death sentence has been taken away.\",\n",
       " 'Thereupon, the Commissioner of Income-tax, West Bengal, applied to the Tribunal to state a case for decision by the High Court under section 66-A of the Act, and the Tribunal accordingly referred the following question to that Court for its decision Whether in the circumstances of this case the Tribunal was right in holding that the sum of Rs. In any case, in the absence of any material in this particular case that personal liberty was likely to be jeopardised, all that we can say is that there was a chance of conviction in which the respondent might have been fined. A finding arrived at on this line of reasoning is obviously vitiated by a serious misapprehension regarding the risk involved in a prosecution under the Ordinance and it cannot be regarded as binding on the Court in dealing with the reference. If, as the High Court realised, in every criminal prosecution where the matter is defended to protect the good name of a business or a professional man, the fear of possible fine or imprisonment must always be there, it must ordinarily be difficult for any Court to say, that the expenses incurred for the defence, -even if they are not to be regarded as the \"personal expenses\" of the person accused, constituted \"expenditure laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business\". In that class of case, no question could arise as to the primary or secondary purpose for which the legal expenses could be said to have been incurred as in the case of a criminal prosecution where the defence cannot easily be dissociated from the purpose of saving the accused person from a possible conviction and imposition of the prescribed penalty.',\n",
       " 'The point taken, however, on behalf of the respondent in their objections was that, having regard to section 31, sub-section (4) of the Act and to the fact that an application under section 14, sub- section (2) for a direction to the umpire to file the award was made to the Gauhati court as early as the 10th August, that court was seized of the matter from that date, and that therefore any application under section 14 OD a later date to another court, though otherwise competent, was barred under section 31, sub-section (4). On appeal, the learned Judges considered it unnecessary for them to dispose of the case on either of the above grounds considered by the single Judge, and held that on the facts it was quite clear that there had been no due filing of the award at all in the Calcutta court under section 14 (2) inasmuch as the awards 884 which were claimed to have been duly filed were, in fact,not filed by the umpire; nor was it shown that they were filed under his authority. This is, at any rate, the assumption on which the question has been dealt with in the High Court, and it has not been contended before us that the filing of the award into court by a party himself 885 though without the authority of the umpire to do so on his behalf, is sufficient compliance with the terms of this section. The learned Judges in coming to the contrary conclusion relied on two facts, namely, that the umpire in his letter to the Gauhati court dated 18th August, 1949, when sending copies of the awards in compliance with the notice issued to him by that court merely stated that he handed over the awards to both the parties, but did not say that he authorised any of them to file the same into court on his behalf. Learned counsel for the appellant urged that the question of the authorisation of the umpire for the filing of the award by the appellant was one that was not raised at all as an objection before the learned single Judge of the High Court, and that such an objection should not have been taken notice of for the first time on appeal.',\n",
       " 'The Deputy Commissioner of Ajmer, who is the Court of Wards constituted under the Ajmer Government Wards Regulation (I of 1888), took over possession and assumed superintendence of the said estate on the 18th September, 1952, purporting to act under sections 6 and 7 of the Regulation read with section 112 of the Ajmer Tenancy and Land Records Act, 1950 (XLII of 1950), and hence this petition for a writ of mandamus or one in the nature thereof, or for the issue 1051 of a direction to the Court of Wards for restoration of possession of the estate and for an order directing it to forbear from carrying on the superintendence of the estate. The section prescribes penalties for habitual infringement of rights of tenants and reads thus:- \" If a landlord habitually infringes the rights of a tenant under this Act, he shall, notwithstanding anything in section 7 of the Ajmer Government Wards Regulation, 1888 (I of 1888), be deemed to be a \"landlord who is disqualified to manage his own property \" within the meaning of section 6 of the said Regulation and his property shall be liable to be taken under the superintendence of the Court of Wards \". It was conceded by the learned Attorney-General appearing for the State of Ajmere that there was nothing in the contents of either Act XLII of 1950 or Regulation I of 1888 which provided a machinery for determining the question whether a certain landlord was a person who was habitually infringing the rights of his tenants. 1053 The contention that the provisions of section 112 of Act XLII of 1950 read with the provisions of Regulation I of 1888 infringe the fundamental right of the petitioner guaranteed by article 19 (1) (f) of the Constitution, is, in our opinion, well-founded and does not require any elaborate discussion. The learned Attorney-General was not able to draw our attention to any provision in the Court of Wards Act or in Act XLII of 1950 which enabled the landlord, held to be a habitual infringer of the rights of his tenants, to have recourse to a civil court to test the correctness of the determination made by the Court of Wards.',\n",
       " \"It was contended that even on the finding of the Income-tax authorities that the silver bars in question formed part of the stock-in-trade of the business at Calcutta and their removal to Bikaner had been effected only for reasons of security, the said bars having remained there during the rest of the accounting year, their value at the market rate at the close of the year being an increment to the goods at Bikaner, the profit accrued at Bikaner (their an Indian State), with the result that it was exempted under section 14 (2) (c). The true purpose of crediting the value of unsold stock is to balance the cost of those goods entered on the other side of the account at the time of their purchase, so that the cancelling out of the entries relating to the same stock from both sides of the account would leave only the transactions on which there have been actual sales in the course of the year showing the profit or loss actually realised on the year's trading. As profits for income-tax purposes are to be computed in conformity with the ordinary principles of commercial accounting, unless, of course, such principles have been superseded or modified by legislative enactments, unrealised profits in the shape of appreciated value of goods remaining unsold at the end of an accounting year and carried over to the following year's account in a business that is continuing are not brought into the charge as a matter of practice, though, as already stated, loss due to a fall in price below cost is allowed even if such loss has not been actually realised. Thus, while the valuation of the unsold stock at the end of each year at market rate which was less than cost was accepted, the valuation of the unsold goods carried over as opening stock of 1922 at Rs. On the finding of the Income-tax authorities that the 582 bars of silver lying at Bikaner had not been really sold but remained part of the unsold stock of the firm's business at the end of the accounting year, the whole of the profits of that year must be taken to have accrued or arisen at Calcutta where the business was carried on, no part of that business having admittedly been transacted at Bikaner.\",\n",

By a resolution passed by the directors of the Aluminium Ltd., Mr. L. G. Bash was appointed to vote and/or from time to time to appoint a special or general proxy to vote for and on behalf of the Aluminium Ltd. in respect of the shares held by it in the respondent company at all ordinary or extraordinary general meetings of the shareholders of the respondent company. The claim of the respondent company was that it should be regarded as a company the directors whereof had a controlling interest therein, inasmuch as Mr. L. G. Bash, one of the directors, had the I authority to exercise the voting power of the Aluminium Ltd. and, 192 as such, could control the affairs of the respondent company and that in computing the standard profits the statutory percentage should be taken at 10 per cent. According to the facts found in the statement of the case the directors of the respondent company do not themselves hold the majority of shares which, on the contrary, are registered in the name of the Aluminium Ltd. and, therefore, according to the principles discussed above, they cannot be said to have \"a controlling interest\" in the respondent company.

       " 'The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J.-This is an appeal from the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta on a reference made by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal under Section 66(1) of the Indian Incometax Act (XI of 1922). On the construction of the several provisions of the deed of trust the High Court held :- \"I am of opinion that in view of these provisions of the trust deed coupled with the uncertainty as regards the beneficiaries and the absence of any obligation to grant any pension, no legal and effective trust was created, and the so-called trust must be held to be void,\" It further held that even if the ownership of the money had passed over to the trustees, still the further provision regarding the application of the money to the payment of pensions being entirely ineffective and void, the money cannot be said to have been expended for the purpose of the business, and that therefore was not an expenditure or an expenditure for the purposes of the business within the meaning of section 10(2)(xv) of the Act. But there are not only a mere trust and a mere power, but there is also known to this court a power which the party to whom it is given is intrusted with and required to execute; and with regard to that species of power, the court considers it as partaking so much of the nature and qualities of a trust, that if the person who has the duty imposed upon him does not discharge it, the court will, to a certain extent, discharge the duty in his room and place\\'. As already stated there is no clear indication in the deed of trust that the bank intended the power to be regarded in the nature of a trust, inasmuch as there was no obligation imposed on the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf to grant any pension to any applicant. It will be appropriate at this stage to consider whether any beneficiary claiming to be entitled to a pension under the terms of the deed could approach the court for the enforcement of any provision purporting to have been made for his benefit Even though he may be qualified under clause 8 to apply for the grant of a pension he could not certainly enforce that provision because there was no obligation imposed at all on the bank or its officers duly authorised in that behalf to grant any pension to him and in the absence of any such obligation imposed upon anybody it would be futile to urge that a valid trust was created in the manner contended on behalf of the appellant.',\n",

Two contentions were raised on behalf of the assessee before the Income-tax Officer, the first being whether the aforesaid sum could be called a \"reserve\" within the meaning of rule 2(1) of the Rules in Schedule II to the Business Profits Tax Act and whether it should be included in its reserves while determining the capital on the 1st April, 1946; the second that the proportionate profits of the assessee for three months, between the 1st January, 1946, and the 1st April, 1946, should also be included in the said reserves. Schedule 11 lays down the rule for computing the capital of a company for purposes of business profits tax and rule 2(1) of the Schedule which admittedly applies to the present case lays down that \"Where the company is one to which rule 3 of Schedule I applies, its capital shall be the sum of the amounts of its paid-up share capital and of its reserves in so far as they have not been allowed in computing the profits of the company for the purposes of the Indian Income-tax Act..........\" The point that arises for consideration on the first question is whether the assessee is entitled to treat the sum of Rs. A reserve in the sense in which it is used in rule 2 can only mean profit earned by a company and not distributed as dividend to the shareholders but kept back by the directors for any purpose to which it may be put in future. Regulation 99 of the First Schedule, Table A, lays down \"that the directors may, before recommending any dividend set aside out of the profits of the company such sum as they think proper as a reserve or reserves which shall, at the discretion of the directors, be applicable for meeting contingencies, or for equalising dividends, or for any other purpose to which the profits of the company may be properly applied.........',\n",

Article 8(2) of that Order, which is material for the purposes of this appeal, was in the following terms \"Any contracts made on behalf of the Province of Bengal before the appointed day shall, as from that day (a) if the contract is for purposes which as from that day are exclusively purposes of the Province of West Bengal, be deemed to have been made on behalf of that Province instead of the Province of Bengal: And 381 (b) in any other case be deemed to have been made on behalf of the Province of East Bengal instead of the Province of Bengal ; The case was heard by Sinha J., who by his judgment dated the 10th August, 1947, held, amongst other things that the lease was entered into for purposes which as from the 15th August, 1947, were exclusively purposes of the, Province of West Bengal and that under articlc 8(2)(a) of the said Order the appellant was clearly liable for the rents which had accrued previous to the appointed day, that is to say, the 15th 382 August, 1947, and decreed the suit for Rs. Learned Advocate General contends that the liability to pay rent under the lease comes within the expression \"other financial obligations\" to be found in that article. This difficulty does not arise if the expression be construed ejusdem gener is, for so construed it implies an obligation in the nature of an obligation in respect of loans and guarantees incurred or undertaken by the State as held by Harries C J. in Province of West Bengal v.

Provided that- (b) in determining the amount of compensation to be awarded for land acquired in pursuance of this 561 Act the market value referred to in clause first of sub- section (1) of section 23 of the said Act shall be deemed to be the market value of the land on the date of publication of the notification under sub-section (1) of section 4 for the notified area in which the land is included subject to the following condition, that is to say- if such market value exceeds by any amount the market value of the land on the 3 1 st day of December, 1946, on the assumption that the land had been at that date in the state in which it in fact was on the date of publication of the said notification, the amount of such excess shall not be taken into consideration. \" The provision making the declaration of the Government conclusive as to the public nature of the purpose of the acquisition and the limitation of the amount of compensation so as not to exceed the market value of the land on December 31, 1946, were declared ultra vires the Constitution and void. Turning now to the provisions relating to compensation under the impugned Act, it will be seen that the latter part of the proviso to section 8 limits the amount of compensation so as not to exceed the market value of the land on December 31, 1946, no matter when the land is acquired.',\n",

As regards the order of confiscation under section 517, the High Court held that it was not necessary that the property confiscated must be the property in relation to which an offence appears to have been committed but it was enough if ,the property is produced before the court. Mr. Chatterjee on behalf of the appellant stated at the outset that he was not prepared to concede that the appellant's conviction was right but he proceeded on the assumption that even if it was so, section 517 had no application to the case and the court had no jurisdiction to pass the order of confiscation of the gold.\",\n",
       " '171 which the trial is to be held under section 197(2) and in the absence -of any such specification by the said Government, the power under section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code of appointing a Special Magistrate for the trial of the case cannot be exercised by the Madhya Pradesh Government. The contention of learned counsel for the petitioners is based on sub-section (2) of section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which runs as follows :- \" The Governor-General or Governor, as the case may be, exercising his individual judgment may determine the person by whom, the manner in which, the offence or offences for which, the prosecution of such Judge, Magistrate, or public servant is to be conducted, and may specify the Court before which the trial is to be held.\" The argument is that it is for the very Government which sanctioned the prosecution under section 197(1) to specify the Court before which the trial is to be held and no other, and that consequently, in a case to which section 197(1) applies, the exercise of any power under section 14 is excluded. It is said that though the exercise of the power under section 197(2) in so far as it relates to specification of the Court is concerned is discretionary and optional, but if in an individual case, that power is not exercised, it must be taken that the appropriate Government did not feel called upon to allot the case \\'to any special Court, and that, therefore, such allotment by another Government under section 14 would affect or nullify the power of the appropriate Government under section 197(2). In addition to the above three points, learned counsel for the petitioners has also raised a further point that in the present case Shri K. L. Pandey who was first appointed as a Special Magistrate for the trial of the case, and to whose file on such appointment this case was transferred, was later on appointed as acting Sessions Judge for some time and ceased to have this case before him.',\n",

He contended that as the petition was not presented within the time as required by section 81 of the Act, it was liable to be dismissed under the mandatory provision in section 85, and that when the matter came before the Election Tribunal, its jurisdiction was only to pass the order which the Election Commission ought to have passed, and that the petition should accordingly have been dismissed in limine us not maintainable. Krishnaswami Ayyangar is that the order is not valid, because it was passed not on any application of the party praying that the delay might be excused but suo motu; and such an application, it is contended, is a condition to the exercise of jurisdiction under that proviso, Support for this 145 contention was sought in the decisions under section 5 of the Limitation Act, holding that it was incumbent, on the party praying that delay might be excused under that section to clearly allege and strictly prove the grounds therefor, We are not impressed by this contention. It wag also argued for the appellant that the power conferred by the proviso to section 85 could, on its true construction, be exercised only when the petitioner moved the matter in person, and as the Election Tribunal had found that that was not done, there was no jurisdiction in the Election Commission to pass the order which it did. Krishnaswami Ayyangar sought to get over this difficulty by contending that the order of the Election Commission sending the petition for hearing by the 148 Election Tribunal under section 86 of the Act, was without jurisdiction, because an order under that section could be passed only when the petition is not liable to be dismissed under section 85 as when the requirements of sections 81, 83 or 117 are complied with ; but that when those provisions are not complied with, its only power under that Act was to dismiss it under section 85; that, in consequence, the Election Tribunal acquired no jurisdiction to hear the petition by virtue of that order, and that all the proceedings taken under it culminating in the order now under appeal were a nullity.',\n",

If, on the contrary, it can be shown, that there was no such defect in the title of the vendor, or in other words that he was under no such disability, even under the Mahomedan Law itself, it would follow as a matter of course, that there was no-defect in the title of the purchaser, at the time of its creation........... Now, so far as I can judge of the Mahomedan Law of pre-emption from the materials within my reach, it appears to me to be perfectly clear that a right of pre-emption is nothing more than a mere right of re- purchase, not from the vendor but from the vendee, who is treated, for all intents and purposes, as the full legal owner of the property which is the subject-matter of that right.\" The Privy Council in Jadhulal v. Janki Koer expressly laid down that when a custom of pre-emption is established by evidence to prevail amongst non-Muslims in a particular locality \"it must be presumed to be founded on and co- extensive with the Muhammadan Law on that subject unless the contrary is shown; that the Court may as between Hindus ad- minister a modification of the law as to the circumstances under which the right may be claimed when it is shown that the custom in that respect does not go to the whole length of the Muhammadan Law of preemption, but that the assertion of right by suit must always be preceded by an observance of the preliminary forms prescribed in the Muhammadan Law which forms appear to have been invariably observed and insisted on through the whole of the cases from the earliest times of which we have record.\" The various judgments which have been made exhibits in this case do not give any indication whatsoever that under the custom, as it prevails in the city of Banaras, pre-emption could be claimed only against persons who are the inhabitants of the place or are domiciled therein and that it could not be enforced in respect of a property situated in the city, the owner of which is not a native of that place.',\n",

Such order for -return may be made by warrant under the hand of the magistrate making, it, and may be executed according to the tenor thereof\" A comparison between the provisions of Part I and Part II of the Act makes it clear that with regard to 285 offences relating to which Part I has application a fugitive when apprehended could not be committed to prison and surrendered unless the magistrate was satisfied that on the evidence produced before him there was a strong or probable case against him, while in regard to a fugitive governed by Part II of the Act it was not necessary to arrive at such a finding before surrendering him. Those of the countries which still form part of British Possessions and which along with British India were put into a group may legitimately decline to reciprocate with India in the matter of surrender of fugitive offenders on the ground that notwithstanding article 372 of our Constitution India was no longer a British Possession and therefore the Fuogitive Offenders Act, 1881, did not apply to India and they were not bound in the absence of a new treaty to surrender their nationals who may have committed extraditable offences in the territories of India. In these circumstances it is not possible to work out the sections of the Fugitive Offenders Act and apply them to the situation that has arisen after the coming into force of the Constitution of India. We do not think that it is necessary in the present case to enter into a discussion of the question whether British Possessions with which India was grouped under Part 11 of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, should now be treated as foreign States qua India and that offenders apprehended can be surrendered under the Indian Extradition Act or any other law, provided a prima facie case is made against them as the proceedings taken against the respondents were specifically taken Under section 14 of the Fugitive Offenders Act, 1881, and it is not the practice of this Court to decide questions which are not properly raised before it or which do not arise directly for decision.',\n",

On a plain and grammatical construction of these provisions it was obvious that once you had an immovable property which when the Defence of India Act expired, that is on the 30th September, 1946, was subject to any requisition effected under the Act and the rules, that immovable property continued to be subject to requisition until the expiry of the Ordinance, no matter whether the requisition order to which the immovable property was subject was of a limited duration or an indefinite duration. If there was in existence on the 30th September, 1946, any requisition order which would have ceased to be operative or come to an end by reason of the fact that it was limited in duration and 213 was to expire on the 30th September, 1946, the non obstante clause saved that from the operation of clause 3 of the Ordinance and such requisition order could not continue in operation until the expiry of the Ordinance as therein provided. XIX of 1946, the words of clause 3 read along with the definition of requisitioned land contained in clause 2(3) of the Ordinance are quite clear and it would not be within the province of the Courts to speculate as to what was intended to be covered by clause 3 of the Ordinance when the only interpretation which could be put upon the terms thereof is that all requisitioned lands, that is, all immoveable properties which when the Defence of India Act, 1939, expired were subject to any requisition effected under the Act and the rules were to continue 214 to be subject to requisition until the expiry of the Ordinance. It is to be regretted that the Court of appeal did not respond to Mr. Palkhivala\\'s request, but we have not had the benefit of the judgment of the Court of appeal on those points which found favour with the trial Court and which were not considered by the Court of appeal and we cannot help remanding the matter to the Court of appeal with a direction that the appeal be disposed of on all the points which were dealt with by the trial Court.',\n",

About a year later on July 15, 1940, the three sons of Ram Narayan, who 61 474 are the reversionary heirs of Haripada after the death of Rashmoni, commenced the present suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore claiming to recover possession of the property on the allegation, that the security bond executed by Rashmoni not being supported by legal necessity, the sale in execution of the mortgage as well as the subsequent conveyance in favour of Sarat Kumar Das could pass only the right, title and interest of Rashmoni and could not affect the reversionary rights of the plaintiffs. As has been mentioned already, by an order passed by the High Court on the revision petition of Mohini and his mother against the order of the Subordinate Judge dated the 23rd February, 191 1, the whole amount of money deposited in Court on the 1st, February, 191 1, with the exception of a small sum that was paid to a creditor, with the consent of both parties, was detained in Court. Undoubtedly the accounts were still to be investigated but what necessity there possibly could be for Rashmoni to execute, after the High Court had made the order as stated above, a security bond by which she mortgaged all the properties that were allotted to Haripada in his share as an additional security for the entire loan of Rs. \" In the present case, there is no scope for an argument that there was such representation of legal necessity or that on bona fide enquiry the alienee satisfied herself \\'that there was such a necessity, for as I have already pointed out the security bond itself states that it was in consideration of benefits already received and with a view to induce Suhasini to forbear from proceeding against Mohini, that the bond was being executed.',\n",

The result was that the new Act of 1922 came into effect in the Patna City area and the sections of the Bengal Act which were applied by reason of the Patna Administration Act continued in force in the Patna Administration area. But to pick out a section is to apply a part of an Act, and to pick out a part is to effect a modification, and as the previous decision holds that a part of an Act can be extended, it follows that a section or sections can be picked out and applied, as in Burah\\'s case(1) where just that was done; also, for the same reason that the whole or a part of an Act can be modified; it follows that a section can also be modified. It follows that when a section of an Act is selected for application, whether it is modified or not, it must be done so as not to effect any change of policy, or any essential change in the Act regarded as a whole. Subject to that limitation we hold that section 3(1)(f) is intra vires, that is to say, we hold that any section or sections of the Bihar and Orissa Municipal Act of 1922 can be picked out and applied to \"Patna\" provided that does not effect any essential change in the Act or alter its policy.',\n",

Prior to the commencement of the Constitution, under section 94(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935, a chief commissioner\\'s Province could be administered by the GovernorGeneral acting to such extent, as he thought fit, through a Chief Commissioner to be appointed by him in his discretion; and under section 3(8) of the General Clauses Act, as it stood before the 26th of January, 1950, the expression \"Central Government\" included, in the case of a Chief Commissioner\\'s Province, the Chief Commissioner acting within the scope of authority given to him under section 94(3) of the Government of 744 India Act, 1935. Chatterjee contends that in the absence of such delegation under article 239 the Chief Commissioner of Ajmer cannot be regarded as \"Central Government\" as defined in section 3(8) (b) (ii) of the General Clauses Act as it stands at present and consequently he could not be held to be the \"appropriate Government\" within the meaning of section 2(b) (ii) of the Minimum Wages Act. Under section 27 of the Act however\\' power has been given to the \"appropriate Government\" to add to either part of the schedule any employment in respect to which it is of opinion that minimum wages shall be fixed by giving notification in a particular manner, and 748 thereupon the schedule shall, in its application to the State, be deemed to be amended accordingly. There is undoubtedly an element of delegation implied in the provision of section 27 of the Act, for the Legislature in a sense, authorises another body, specified by it, to do something which it might do itself But such delegation, if it can be so called at all, does not in the circumstances of the present case appear to us to be unwarranted and unconstitutional.',\n",

The company states in its petition that the minimum wages fixed by the State Government of Ajmer is altogether prohibitory and it is not at all possible for the company to carry on its business on payment of such wages. Though the majority of workers were agreeable to work on the wages fixed by the Industrial Tribunal, the company is unable to open the mills by reason of the fact that the Minimum Wages Act makes it a criminal offence not to pay the wages fixed under the Act. Mr. Seervai, who appears- in support of both these petitions, has invited us to hold that the material provisions of the Minimum Wages Act are illegal and ultra vires by reason of their conflicting with the fundamental rights of the employers and the employed guaranteed under article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution and that they are not protected by clause (6) of that article. If the labourers are to be secured in the enjoyment of minimum wages and they are to be protected against exploitation by their employers, it is absolutely necessary that restraints should be imposed upon their freedom of contract and such restrictions cannot in any sense be said to be unreasonable.',\n",

Condition 4(a) compels a licensee to exhibit at each performance one or more approved films of such length and for such length of time as the Provincial Government or Central Government may direct. Whether a maximum of 2,000 feet would be reasonable is a matter we need not consider but as this is mentioned as the minimum it is obvious that the Government may compel the licensee to exhibit a film of 10,000 or 12,000 feet which in effect will amount to pushing out of the film intended to be shown by the licensee during the time allotted.',\n",

As regards the question whether the petitioner was given reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him, the legal position in that respect and the nature of opportunity to be granted was stated by the Privy Council in the case of High Commissioner for India v. I. M. Lall(1) and it was held that when a stage is reached when definite conclusions have been come to as to the charges, and the actual punishment to follow is provisionally determined on, that the statute gives the civil servant an opportunity for which subsection (3) of section 240 of the Government of India Act, 1935 (which corresponds to Article 311) makes provision, and that at that stage a reasonable opportunity has to be afforded to the civil servant concerned. The time allowed, in our opinion, was more than sufficient for him to enter on his defence and having failed to do so, he cannot be heard to say that he was not given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him. In the present case there can be no manner of doubt that the notice signed by the Chief Secretary of the State and expressed to be on behalf of the Government and giving opportunity to the petitioner to show cause against the action proposed to be taken against him was in substantial compliance with the provisions of the article. In these circumstances, the contention of Mr. Thomas that as the notice was not expressed as required under Article 166 it was invalid and therefore the requirements of Article 311 were not satisfied in this case must be held to be devoid of force.',\n",
       " 'The Appellate Tribunal agreeing that certain questions of law did arise out of its order drew up a statement of the case which was agreed to by the parties and referred to the High Court the following questions:- (1) Whether the imposition of a tax under the head \" capital gains \" by the Central Legislature was ultra vires 832 (2) Whether the imposition was in any way invalid on the ground that it was done by amending the Indian Income-tax Act ? He submitted that the learned Chief Justice was entirely right in the view that there was a clear line of demarcation that had always been observed by English lawyers and English jurists between income and capital, that the English legislative practice had always recognised this difference and that as the word had come to acquire a certain meaning and a certain -connotation by reason of such legislative practice in England, the British Parliament which enacted the Government of India Act, 1935, must be regarded as having understood and used that word \" income \" in entry 54 in that sense. XIV of 1938(1), observed at pages 36-37 that the rules which apply to the interpretation of other statutes apply equally to the interpretation of a constitutional enactment subject to this reservation that their application is of necessity conditioned by the subject-matter of the enactment itself It should be remembered that the problem before us is to construe a word appearing in entry 54 which is a head of legislative power. in The United Provinces v. Atiqa Begum(2) at page 134 none of the items in the Lists is to be read in a narrow or restricted sense and that each general word should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it. Mr. Kolah concedes that the word \"income\" is understood in the United States and Australia in the wide sense contended for by the learned Attorney-General but he maintains that the law in England is different and, therefore, entry 54 which occurs in a Parliamentary statute should be construed according to the law of England.',\n",

But he held that as the defendants and their predecessors had been in posses- sion of the lands for a very long time without 1171 payment of rent, a presumption of a lost grant could be made in their favour. When a person was found in possession and enjoyment of land for a considerable period of time under an assertion of title without challenge, Courts in England were inclined to ascribe a legal origin to such possession, and when on the facts a title by prescription could not be sustained, it was held that a presumption could be made that the possession was referable to a grant by the owner entitled to the land, but that such grant had been lost. There was a permanent settlement of the zamindari of Burdwan in 1793, and it has been found by all the Courts that in that settlement the suit lands were included as part of the Mal or assessed lands of the estate. We are accordingly of opinion that on the facts found, no presumption of a lost grant could be made in favour of the defendants, and that the plaintiff was entitled to assessment of fair and equitable rent on the holdings in their possession.',\n",

On the issues thus joined between the parties the Authority came to the conclusion that the house rent allowance was \"wages\" as defined in the Act that as a matter of fact, accommodation was offered to the 1st respondent and he refused it; but that even so, the appellant was not entitled to withhold the house rent allowance. E47CPC/ 14 dated the 1st December 1947, particularly rule 3(i) which is in these terms:- \"The house rent allowance will not be admissible to those who occupy accommodation provided by Government or those to whom accommodation has been offered by Government but who have refused it\". It has been argued on behalf of the appellant that the terms of the contract between the parties include the rule quoted above and that therefore the position in law is that there is no absolute right in the 1st respondent to claim the house rent allowance; in other words, it is contended that there is a condition precedent to the claim for house rent allowance being admissible, namely, that the employee should be posted at one of those places, like Bombay, Calcutta, 1350 Madras\\' etc., before the claim for house rent allowance could arise and that there is a condition subsequent, namely, that the employee posted at any one of those places will cease to be entitled to the - allowance if either the Government provides accommodation to the employee in question or the employee-refuses to occupy the accommodation so offered to him. It should be noted at the outset that the learned Attorney- General appearing on behalf of the appellant has not pressed the argument which appears to have been raised in the written statement of the appellant and also before the Authority as would appear from the orders passed by him, that clause (a) excluding \"the value of any house accommodation\" clearly showed that house rent allowance was not included in \"wages\" as defined in section 2(vi) of the Act.',\n",

(1) that the offence was committed by one or other of the members of the unlawful assembly of which he is one, and (2) that the offence was committed in prosecution of the common object or is such that was known to be likely to be so committed. In a case so serious as that which involves the sentences of transportation for life, and of death, and particularly in a case like the present one, where the death sentence has been awarded in the trial court by distinguishing this appellant from all the other accused in respect of his individual act by way of pistol fire, it is difficult to say that the accused has not been prejudiced by the absence of specific charges under sections 307 and 302, Indian Penal Code. But it appears from the order of commitment in this case (which forms part of the present printed record) that with reference to that report there was pending, at the date of the committal, a cross-case against some of the prosecution witnesses in the present case for the same incident.\",\n",

It being undisputed that these three remained in India throughout, it is contended that the property at the date of the notification was the property of these three sons and not of Kumar Rani and that, therefore, the Bihar Administration of Evacuee Property Ordinance, 1949, has no application to the facts. In view of the fact that her plea as to the reason for such migration has not been accepted, she can well be taken to have left India for Pakistan in the circumstances set out in this definition, and after the prescribed date.

The corresponding provisions of the Indian Companies Act have been almost bodily incorporated from those of the English Companies Act and if there was nothing more, the position of the secured creditor here also would be the same as that obtaining in England and he would also be outside the winding up and a sale by him without the intervention of the Court would be valid and could not be challenged as void under section 232(1) of the Indian Companies Act. It was pointed out that these words did not find their place in the corresponding section 228(1) of the English Companies Act and therefore even though any attachment, distress or execution put in force without leave of the Court against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding up was void under the terms of the section 232(1) as it originally stood, the words \"or any sale held without leave of the Court of any of the properties\" of the company were wide enough to include not only a sale held through the intervention of the Court but also a sale effected by the secured creditor without the intervention of the Court whether the sale was by private treaty or by public auction. The position was rightly summed up by the High Court as under:- \"We thus reach the position that no leave of Court was needed before the Receiver appointed by the mortgagee debenture-holders exercised the power of sale and that as there is no allegation of want of bona fides or recklessness or fraud against the Receiver in exercising such a power, it would follow that the sale held by the Receiver is valid and effectual to convey title to the purchaser and that such a sale cannot be avoided on the ground either of want of due notice given by the Receiver before effecting the sale or on the ground of undervalue\".',\n",

The petitioners averred that the imposition of tax on sale or purchase of tobacco rolled into bidis exported out of Madhya Pradesh in the manner described was in contravention of article 286 (1) (a) of the Constitution, that the tobacco purchased by them for the purpose of making bidis exported outside Madhya Pradesh was never intended for use as raw material for the making of bidis for the purpose of consump- tion in Madhya Pradesh and section 4, sub-section (6) of the Act had no application to the tobacco so used and there was no liability to pay the alleged tax and that to the best of the petitioners' information tobacco bad not been notified by the State Government in the Gazette for the purpose of section 12(A) of the Act 65 512 and that the Sales Tax authorities, under the Act, were, 0therefore, not entitled to levy any tax on the petitioners. The Respondents filed a return denying the contentions of the petitioners and submitted that the petitioners by purchasing tobacco which was entered in their registration certificate as raw material for the manufacture of bidis for sale by actual delivery in Madhya Pradesh for consumption in that State made themselves liable to pay the tax by exporting bidis to other States and thus utilising it for a different purpose under section 4(6) of the Act. If, therefore, a dealer who has got himself registered as dealer under the provisions of section 8(1) of the Act is sought to be made liable in respect of transactions of sale effected, by him he could claim exemption from such liability if the transactions of sale or purchase took place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce after the 31st March, 1951, except in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide. The result, therefore, is that the Respondents will be restrained from enforcing the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, and its provisions against the petitioners and from imposing a tax in respect of the transactions in question and in particular from imposing a tax on the purchase price of goods purchased on the declarations under Rule 26 being goods specified in the registration certificate as intended for use as raw material in the manufacture of goods for sale by actual delivery in Madhya Pradesh for the purpose of consumption in that State but utilised for any other purpose tinder the provisions of section 4(6) of the Act.\",\n",
       " 'It is contended for the appellant that in the petition there was no mention of the bargain on which the finding of bribery by the Tribunal was based, that the charge in the petition related only to the order dated 7-12-1951, and that accordingly it was not open to the petitioner to travel beyond the petition and adduce evidence in proof of a bargain which had not been pleaded. It is next contended that there is no evidence or finding that the sweepers were entitled to vote in the Constituency, or that the appellant was a candidate as defined in section 79(2) at the time when the bargain was made. this again is an objection which was not taken before the Tribunal, and on the evidence of the witnesses examined on the side of the petitioner which was accepted by the Tribunal, the appellant would be a prospective candidate as defined in section 79(b) of the Act. Provided that no person shall be named in the order under sub-clause (ii) of clause (a) unless(a) he has been given notice to appear before the Tribunal and to show cause why he should not be so named; and (b) if he appears in pursuance of the notice, he has been given an opportunity of cross-examining any witness who has already been examined by the Tribunal, and has given evidence against him, of calling evidence in his defence and of being heard The point for decision is whether it was obligatory on the part of the Tribunal to issue notice under the above proviso to parties to the election petition before recording a finding under section 99(1)(a). Further, even if we agree with the contention of the appellant that notice under the proviso should be given to a party to the petition, seeing that the reliefs which could be claimed in the election petition under section 84 are those mentioned in section 98, and that action under section 99 (1) (a) is to be taken at the time when the order under section 98 is pronounced, there is no insuperable difficulty in treating the notice to the party in the election petition as notice for purposes of the proviso to section 99(1) (a) as well.',\n",
       " 'On 10-10-1947 they made an award in which, on the basis of the purchases made by the appellant on 11-8-1947 which were accepted by them, they gave credit to the respondent for Rs. It may be argued that if the contract note is only intimation of a sale or purchase on behalf of the con- stituent, then it is not a contract of employment, and that in consequence, there is no agreement in writing for arbitration as required by the Arbitration Act. We accordingly hold that the contract notes contained an agreement in writing to refer disputes arising out of the employment of the appellant as broker to arbitration, and that they fell outside the scope of section 6 of Act VIII of 1925, that the arbitration proceedings are accordingly competent, and that the award made therein is not open to objection on the ground that Exhibit A is void. Now, Rule 167 applies only to forward contracts, and the basis of the contention of the respondent is that inasmuch as the contract notes, Exhibit A, have been held by the learned Judges of the High Court not to be ready delivery contracts but forward contracts, they would be void under Rule 167(c), even if they were not hit by section 6 of Act VIII of 1925. It was with reference to these rules which under the contract notes were to be read as part of the con- tract, that the learned Judges held that the contracts were not ready delivery contracts as defined in sec- 866 tion 3(4) of Act VIII of 1925.',\n",
       " 'The Magistrate, however, held that he had a discretion under section 363 whether he should direct demolition, and that this was not a fit case in which an order should be made for demolition, because the constructions being on the fifth storey could not obstruct light and air and thereby inconvenience the neighbours, and there was no complaint from the residents of the locality, and that as the respondent had already been fined in pro- ceedings under section 488, an order for demolition would be to penalise him twice over for the same offence. He agreed with the Magistrate that under section 363 the court had a discretion whether it should order demolition or not, and that as the Corporation had taken proceedings under section 488 and was content to have a fine imposed on the respondent for breach of Rule 62, it would be unjust to permit it thereafter to start proceedings under section 363 for the further relief of demolition of the building. Chakravarti, C. J. and 999 S. R. Das Gupta, J. who heard this application, considered that two questions of general importance arose on which it was desirable to have the decision of this Court, viz., (1) whether the Corporation was precluded from taking proceedings under section 363 of the Act by reason of its having taken proceedings prior thereto under section 488 of the Act read with Rule 62 of Schedule XVII, and (2) whether the question of inconvenience to neighbours was relevant for the purpose of deciding whether an order for demolition should be made under section 363 of the Act. The grounds on which the orders of the courts below are based are (1) that there has been considerable delay on the part of the appellant in moving in the matter, (2) that as in the proceedings taken under section 488 the respondent has been fined, an order for demolition was not called for, and (3) that the breach of the building rules has not resulted in any inconvenience to the public, nor has there been any complaint from the residents of the locality about this. It must be remembered that the building rules are enacted generally for the benefit of the public, and where those rules have been violated and proceedings are taken for an order for demolition of the building under section 363, what has to be decided is whether the breaches are of a formal or trivial character, in which case the im- position of a fine might meet the requirements of the case, or whether they are serious and likely to affect adversely the interests of the public, in which case it would be proper to pass an order for demolition.',\n",

At the adjourned hearing Mr. Mani appeared in person, unrobed as directed, but with the advocate on 985 record sitting by his side. They held that the language of article 31 (1) was similar and decided that article 31 (1) did not apply to invasions of a right by a private individual and consequently no writ under article 32 would lie in such a case. The learned Judges examined the lady, who is 25 years old, in person, on 20-10-1954 and on the strength of her statement, which they recorded, they held that she was not under any restraint either in the house or outside and so dismissed the application on 10-11-1954. The petition does not disclose that Mr. Mani made any attempt to consult the person who he says is the husband of the lady (a fact which is disputed and on which we express no opinion) nor does it show that he made any attempt to contact either the lady or her father or even her uncle.',\n",
       " 'On the second question, he held that section 10 applied only to properties of the evacuee, and that the movables in respect of which directions were given, ceased to be the property of the evacuee by reason of the sale in favour of the appellants, and that in consequence, the directions with reference to them were unauthorised. By their judgment dated 13-4- 1954, they held that on the plain language of section 12 it would apply whenever there was a lease, and that lease was in respect of property belonging to the evacuee, that there was no warrant for imposing a further limitation on that section that that lease should also have been granted by the evacuee, and that accordingly the Custodian had power to issue the notice, Exhibit C, for cancelling the lease. that for the reasons given by him the Custodian had no authority under section 10 to issue any directions with reference thereto. This was a contention which was open to the appellants on the terms of the section as it stood even before the amendment, but it was not put forward at any stage prior to the bearing of this appeal and that by itself would be sufficient ground for declining to entertain it which it may be noted is now sought to be raised by a supplemental proceeding under Order 16, rule 4 of the Supreme Court Rules. It was next contended by Mr. Desai that even if the Custodian had the power under section 12 to cancel the lease in favour of the appellants, be bad no power under that section to cancel the agreement to sell the mills and the factory to them, which was one of the matters contained in Exhibit A, that the notice, Exhibit C, was to that extent without juris,diction, and that the respondent should accordingly be prohibited from cancelling that portion of Exhibit A in pursuance of Exhibit C. But the notice in terms refers firstly to the lease which it is proposed to cancel, and secondly to the movables in respect of which certain directions were given.',\n",

The order of the petitioner\\'s detention is also challenged as unwarranted and illegal as the order sent to the jail authorities does not bear the signature of the Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir and also because the petitioner has not been supplied, in spite of demands made by him, with the grounds on which the order of his detention is based, \"in clear violation of his fundamental rights guaranteed under clause (5) of article 22 of the Con- stitution as extended to the State of Jammu and Kashmir by the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 1954\". The proviso to the section just quoted makes provision for such cases as come within the purview of section 3(1) (a) (i) of the Act; that is to say, a person in the position of the petitioner who has been detained for preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State of Jammu and Kashmir is outside the general rule laid down in section 8(1) if the Government declares as it has done in this case, that it would be against the public inte- rest to communicate to him the grounds on which the detention order has been made. It must therefore be held that the petitioner was not entitled to know the grounds upon which he had been detained beyond what is disclosed in the order itself It was argued that the order of detention served on the petitioner or the order sent to the officer in charge of the jail where he was detained, did not bear the signature of the Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir.',\n",
       " 'We agree that the examination was not as full or as clear as it should have been but we are not satisfied that there was any prejudice. His main grievance on this score is that none of the appellants has been asked about the common object and he said it is obvious that most of them could very reasonably have said that they bad no idea that it was murder and that they did not even know that any of the members of the assembly carried lethal weapons. It would be impossible on the facts of this case to hold that the members of the assembly did not know that murder was likely to be committed in pursuance of a common object of that kind by an assembly as large as the one we have there. What we have to assess here is the explanation which counsel says each appellant could reasonably have given in the trial Court if he had been asked for one, namely that 1064 he did not know that any member of the assembly carried lethal weapons and that murder was likely to result. We do not intend to lay down any hard and fast rule but we do wish to emphasise that what we have done in this case is not to be regarded as a precedent and that in future it will be increasingly difficult to induce this Court to look into questions of prejudice if the requisite material is not placed before it and if appellants deliberately withhold from the Court assistance which it is in their power to render; an inference adverse to them must be expected if that attitude is adopted.',\n",

The Assistant Sessions Judge, however, disagreed with that verdict and made a reference to the High Court stating in the letter of reference that on the evidence recorded before him the appellants had been in possession of the Palani and the Punjaul but were dispossessed of the same some time prior to the passing of the decree in the title suit on December 16,1950, and were therefore justified in taking steps for recovery of possession thereof from Kailash Rai on March 4, 195 1, and if in that process the appellants set fire to the Palani and the Punjaul they were only destroying their own property and were not guilty of the offence of committing mischief by fire as alleged by the prosecution. The Assistant Sessions Judge tried to analyse the working of the minds of the jury in arriving at the verdict which they did and though he agreed with the alleged finding of fact reached by the jury in regard to the possession of the Palani and the Punjaul, disagreed with the law as allegedly applied by the jury and therefore disagreed with the majority verdict. When the reference was heard before the High Court, the counsel for the appellants only contended that the charge addressed by the Assistant Sessions Judge to the jury was defective and he did not invite the High Court, as he should have done, to consider the entire evidence and to acquit or convict the appellants of the offences of which the jury could have convicted them upon the charges framed and placed before it, after giving due weight to the opinions of the learned Sessions Judge and the jury as required by a. If the High Court came to the conclusion that the evidence was such that it was possible for the jury to take the view that it did even though the judge thought that they should have taken another view the reference would not have been justified and the High Court should have accepted the opinion of the jury.',\n",

The Bombay High Court has held that when an appeal is presented out of time, and there is no order of condonation of delay under section 30(2), there is, in law, no appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, and that an order by him rejecting the appeal does not fall within section 31 and is not appealable: Commissioner of Income-tax v. Mysore Iron and Steel Works(1) and K. K. Porbunderwalla v. Commissioner of Income-tax(2); but that if the appeal is admitted after an order of condonation is made under section 30(2), an order subsequently passed dismissing it on the ground of limitation would be one under section 31 and would be appealable under section 33 and the result will be the same even when the appeal is admitted without (1) . But the question still remains whether the view taken in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Mysore Iron 23 174 and Steel Works(1) and K. K. Porbunderwalla v Commissioner of Income-tax (2) that an appeal which is filed beyond the period of limitation is, in the eye of law, no appeal, unless and until there is a condonation of delay, and that, in consequence, an order passed thereon cannot be held to be passed in appeal so as to fall within section 31 is right. Then, on the application of the Commissioner of Income-tax, the Tribunal referred to the High Court under section 66(1) of the Income-tax Act the following question:',\n",

It was argued that the intention of the Act was to create by means of clause (d) an offence different from a single act of bribery and that it can come into play only when there is no offer to give an d acceptance of a bribe by a public servant. Under the Act as it stood before it was amended by Act XVII of 1955, every railway servant was deemed, to be a public servant only for the purposes of Chapter IX of the Indian Penal Code and it was provided by sub-clause (4) that \"notwithstanding anything in section 21 of the Indian Penal Code a railway servant shall not be deemed to be a public servant for any of the purposes of that Code except those mentioned in Chapter IX\". The Prevention of Corruption Act provides by section 2 that \"For the purposes of this Act, \\'public servant\\' means a public servant as defined in section 21 of the Indian Penal Code\". 44 it was urged by his learned counsel that he was only a munim of a firm and not a partner or a proprietor as the other appellants and that it could not be stated of him that he was interested in giving or attempting to give any bribe for hushing up the case.',\n",

Mr. Pathak further contended that there was an error on the face of the record in the order passed by the State Government as it had refused to consider seniority or experience in motor transport as a factor for the granting of a permit and it thought that it could come to any conclusion it liked and reference was made to paragraph 8 of the affidavit filed on behalf of the State Government in the High Court. It is not disputed that in fact orders were passed by the Regional Transport Authority and the Board, authorities subordinate to the State Government, and that these orders existed when the appellant and respondent No. Before section 64-A was inserted into the Act by an Act of the legislature of the State of Madras, it might have been possible to contend that the order of a Regional Transport Authority which bad not been appealed against and the order of the appropriate authority under section 64, where an appeal bad been made, were incapable of interference by the State Government for lack of statutory authority. To hold that the opinion of the Regional Transport Authority and the 266 Board that the facilities for operation were equal as between these persons was a reasonable view would be to constitute the court as the final authority in a matter, in which, by the provisions of the Act, that function was accorded to the State Government.',\n",

In the present case, it was admitted that there was a formal dedication; and the controversy is only as to the scope of- the dedication, and that is also a mixed question of law and fact, the decision of which must depend on the application of legal concepts of a public and a private endowment to the facts found, and that is open to consideration in this appeal. In accordance with this theory, it has been held that when property is dedicated for the worship of a family idol, it is a private and not a public endowment, as the persons who are entitled to worship at the shrine of the deity can only be the members of the family, (1) [1910] I.L.R.

The learned Judges of the Chief Court in affirming the decisions of the courts below that the temple was built for the benefit of the members of the family, observed that there was nothing in the will pointing \"to a conclusion that the trust was a public one\", and that its provisions were not \"inconsistent with the property being a private endowment\".',\n",

If he was thus not an officer of the Government, he could not be a public servant within the meaning of section 21, Indian Penal Code nor could he be a public servant for the purposes of Act 11 of 1947 and could not be convicted of the offence under section 5(1)(d) of Act II of 1947. if therefore on the facts of a particular case the Court comes to the conclusion that a person is not only in the service or pay of the \\'Government but is also performing a public duty, he has delegated to him the functions of the Government or is in any event performing duties immediately\\' auxiliary to those of some one who is an officer of the Government and is therefore \\'an officer\\' of the Government within the meaning of section 21(9), Indian Penal Code. 7 Madras 18, 690 an officer of the Government and the duties which he performed were immediately auxiliary to those of the Works Manager who, beside being an officer of the Government was also armed with some authority or representative character qua the Government. The appellant was thus, even on a narrow interpretation of the dicta of West, J. in 12 Bombay High Court Reports 1, an officer in the service or pay of the Government performing as such a public duty entrusted to him by the Government and was therefore, a public servant within the meaning of section 21 of the Indian Penal Code.',\n",

If therefore,the Record of Rights show that the full assessment is being levied in respect of these lands, and that services are not required to be performed and they are described as Japti Sanadi Inam lands, meaning thereby that they were once Sanadi lands, but in respect of which there has been resumption by the Government, the conclusion must inevitably follow that these lands have ceased to be lands held on Sanadi tenure and are held in ordinary occupancy rights\". The learned counsel for the appellants has vehemently argued that the High Court was in error in concluding that the lands in question had ceased to be Watan lands simply because the service attaching to them had been dispensed with and full assessment levied by Government. But it has been argued on behalf of the appellants that it is common ground, that the Sanadi Inam lands were once Watan property and that once the property is impressed with the character of inam lands, they continue to bear that character, because the Government have not been authorised by any law to change their character. On the other hand, the provisions of section 22 of the Act clearly predicate that a Watan may lapse in part or in whole or may be confiscated or otherwise lawfully resumed by Government and that in such cases it is lawful for Government to attach such land to a newly created Watan in favour of such persons as may be appointed by Government.',\n",

Having regard to all these circumstances and the fact that -must be assumed against the appellant that an airworthy aircraft was taken off for flight and that a person like Phillips who knew flying sufficiently well and who was discharged the previous day, was deliberately taken into the aircraft, we are satisfied that the finding of the Courts below, viz., that the flight to Pakistan was intentional and not accidental, was justified. It has been strenuously urged that if the flight was intended to be to Pakistan the appellant and Phillips would not have contacted Kapoor and requested him to send them back to Delhi.

It is clear, therefore, that where a person is charged with criminal misconduct and it is seen that he is in possession of property or income which could not have been amassed or earned by the official remuneration which he had obtained, then the court is entitled to come to the conclusion that the amassing of such wealth was due to bribery or corruption and the person is guilty of an offence of criminal misconduct. Whereas under s. 342, Indian Penal Code, as it stood before the recent amendment, no accused person was entitled to be administered on oath and thereby competent to testify in a court of law in a case in which he is accused; under s. 7 any person charged with an offence punishable under s' 161 or s. 165 or 165-A of the Indian Penal Code, or under sub-s. Therefore, it was open to the prosecution to proceed with a trial under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code or under s. 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act even before the Amendment of the latter Act by Act LlX of 1952 and of the prosecution was launched under s. 409 and if the status of the accused was such that no sanction was required under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, then the prosecution is good and the conviction Is proper notwithstanding the fact that if the prosecution had been launched under s. 5(2), a sanction would have been necessary. Our conclusion, therefore, is that the -offence created under s. 5(1)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act is distinct and separate from the one under s. 405 of the Indian Penal Code and, therefore, there can be no question of s. 5(1)(c) repealing s. 405 of the Indian Penal Code.\",\n",

The bond executed: by him in 1953 was a bond unknown to the law of the Republic of India under the Code of Criminal Procedure at the time of its execution. Section 514 of the Criminal Procedure Code empowers a court to forfeit a bond which has been executed under the provisions of that Code and since the bond executed by the respondent is not one under the Code of Criminal Procedure, resort could not be had to the provisions of s. 514 of the Code to forfeit the same. 4 of the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, the form of the bond stood amended by the substitution of the word \"Government\" therein in place and stead of the words \"Her Majesty The Queen\" and the bond should be read accordingly. The fact, however, remains that the respondent had not bound himself either to the Government of the Union of India or that of the State of Uttar Pradesh to have his bond forfeited on his failure to produce the accused before the court and he is entitled to say that no order of forfeiture could be passed against him with respect to a bond which was not one under the Code and which was one unknown to the law, as contained in the Code, at the, time of its execution.',\n",

Therefore both for the assessment years 1948- 49 and 1949-50 the law applicable would be the Patiala Income-tax law and not the Indian Income-tax Act and consequently no appeal against the order of the' Income-tax Officer was competent. When he came to this Court, he brought with him his mature judicial experience and learning and his sense of justice and fairplay.

The High Court answered the question in the negative on the ground that there was neither a sale nor a transfer of the managing agency within the meaning of s. 12B of the Act. There is also no dispute that the managing agency of the two mills which the assessee company held was a capital asset. The Income-tax authorities held that there was a sale of the managing agency; but the Appellate Tribunal held that there was no sale in the strict sense but only a transfer of the managing agency to the managed companies, that is, the Dharamsi Company and the Shapurji Broacha Company. In our opinion, the Bombay High Court correctly held that whereas under the original contract the Dalmia Company wanted the managing agency to be transferred, which meant that it wanted the benefit of that contract to be vested in it and was also prepared to accept the burden of the obligations that went with that contract, under the substituted contract, the Dalmia Company did not want the managing agency to be assigned to it; on the contrary, it wanted the assessee company to relinquish its rights in the managing agency of the two mills by resigning.',\n",

It was under this rule that the order was statedly made on October 30, 1952, and as the respondent had completed the age of 50 on that date, the order would be within the scope of the authority conferred on the State by that rule, and must be upheld, unless the rule itself is held to be ultra Vires. Now, the stand taken by the respondent in the Court below was that an order retiring an officer before the age of superannuation was in substance one of dismissal or removal and must, in order to be valid, satisfy the requirements of Art. Mr. N. C. Chatterjee for the respondent contends that that decision does not govern the present appeal, and his argument in support of this contention may thus be stated: The rule as to compulsory retirement embodied in Note I to art. The fact to be noted is that while misconduct and inef- ficiency are factors that enter into the account where the order is one of dismissal or removal or of retirement, there is this difference that while in the case of retirement they merely furnish the background and the enquiry, if held-and there is no duty to hold an enquiry-is only for the satis- faction of the authorities who have to take action, in the case of dismissal or removal, they form the very basis on which the order is made and the enquiry thereon must be formal, and must satisfy the rules of natural justice and the requirements of Art.',\n",

Inter alia the defendants pleaded that they had no knowledge of the will alleged to have been made by Guranditta Mal and they denied that the plaintiffs were heirs and representa- tives of the mortgagee and therefore had no locus standi to sue.

In the meanwhile, a notice dated September 13, 1954, terminating the appellant's services in the Subordinate Agricultural Service was issued to him by the Director of Agriculture. The order terminating his services amounted to dismissal or removal from the post as it conveyed an imputation of inef- ficiency and unsatisfactory work and the order reverting him from the post held by him in the United Provinces Agricul- tural Service to his original appointment in the Subordinate Agricultural Service amounted to a reduction in his rank, as it was by way of penalty.\",\n",

The relevant documents were proved and exhibited on behalf of the prosecution in the Sessions Court and the learned Additional Sessions Judge confirmed the conviction and the sentence, and dismissed the appeal.

It would therefore be arguable that a notice under section 299 to remove a compound wall unattached to any building could not be a notice 'lawfully given' or a requisition 'lawfully made' within the meaning of section 488(1)(c) of the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1923. It will be noticed that in the case before the Privy Council, the alteration was not only in respect of the section but also of the substance of the accusation, but as the lesser offence under s. 201, had been made out by the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution which was primarily for an offence of murder, their Lordships ruled that ss.\",\n",

Before dealing with this point, it would be relevant to refer to the findings made by both the tribunals in regard to the financial position of the appellant. It is in the background of these findings that Mr. Sen has contended that the wage structure constituted by the Appellate Tribunal would work a hardship on the appellant and his grievance is that in reconstituting the wage structure the Appellate Tribunal was very much influenced by the assumption that the wage structure can never be revised to the prejudice of workmen. Since we have held that the modifications made by the Appellate Tribunal in favour of the existing workmen cannot be successfully challenged by the appellant, we do not think it necessary to consider whether wage structure which has been fixed by the Appellate Tribunal in regard to new entrants into the service of the appellant is justified or not.',\n",

The valuation thus made by the appellant in respect of the value of his relief of partition for the payment of court fees should and must be taken to be the valuation even for the purposes of jurisdiction and it is on this valuation alone that the appellant can be justly called upon to pay court fees both on the plaint and on the memorandum of appeal. In our opinion, the decision of the Division Bench of the Madras High Court that the memorandum of appeal should be taxed for the purposes of court fee under s. 7(iv)(b) of the Act is final under the provisions of s.5 of the Act and it cannot be reopened at this stage.\",\n",

There is no finding by the High Court that the respondent had entered into any forward transactions in British India or at Hapur with any firm other than the Hapur firm and this matter was not agitated before us, nor is there any finding as to the total world income of the respondent and there is no material on the record from which it could be determined. 40(2) and 42(1) of the Act as an assessee for income-tax on the profits made on the respondent\\'s transactions at Hapur and was therefore entitled under the proviso to s. 42(1) to retain the estimated amount of income-tax payable on the amount of the respondent\\'s profits which in this case was deducted, retained and actually paid.

Chatterjee on behalf of the respondents was that the action of the appellant in the matter of the termination of the services of the respondents was punitive in character, that the discharge of the respondents for which permission was sought by the appellant was a punitive discharge, that such discharge was by reason of the alleged misconduct of the respondents falling within cl. 17(b)(viii) thereof and if it was merely a discharge simpliciter, then, no objection could be taken to the same and the appellant would be well within its rights to do so, provided, however, that it was not arbitrary or apricious but was bona fide.

The Court, however, held: \"\"\"\"but it is proved that the respondent had deserted the petitioner, hence the petitioner will get or is entitled to for a decree of divorce\"\"\"\". Hence it is necessary that during all the period that there has been a desertion, the deserted spouse must affirm the marriage and be ready and willing to resume married life on such conditions as may be reasonable. In other words, there can be no desertion without previous cohabitation by the parties. For upholding the judgment and decree of the Family Court, Shri Dinesh Kumar Garg, the learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that as after the decree of divorce the appellant had remarried with one Sudhakar Pandey and out of the second marriage a child is also stated to have been born, it would be in the interest of justice and the parties that the marriage between them is dissolved by a decree of divorce.',\n",

The plea on behalf of the appellant now made, as had been before the courts below, is that those allegations must be considered to have never been on record and not available for being referred or relied upon for any purpose. Apart from observing, from the nature of the allegations and details disclosed that those statements were made by the appellant himself and only at his instance and on instructions, the courts below were of the view that the reply filed on 17.1.90 in court to an application filed by the wife seeking permission to engage her lawyer (mistakenly referred to as appellant's application) and their contents substantially reaffirming what has been stated earlier in the written statement but got withdrawn by subsequent amendment rendered even the so called withdrawal to be of no significance or consequence and that it does not appear to have been genuine, too.\",\n",

Therefore the decision of a foreign Court on title to immovable property within its jurisdiction will be conclusive between the parties in India provided it is a decision of a competent Court and does not suffer from any to the infirmities mentioned in the different clauses in Section 13 of the Code.

There was also a claim made in that application that there was partial disablement to the extent of 35 per cent, and that the payment of compensation should be directed on that basis. On 26 July, 1958, this application was followed up by yet another application presented on behalf of the employee in the same way, in Which the allegation was that there was total disablement in consequence of the injury sustained during the accident and that the determination of the Compensation should be made on that basis. In my option, the very fact that the company discharged the employee on 10 October, 1957 is the clearest proof of the fact that there was a total disablement in this case, particularly when it is seen that the company did not, in its statement of objections before the Commissioner, make an allegations that notwithstanding the serious injury sustained by the employee it was possible for him to obtain some kind of employment although not similar to the one which he was having with the company, somewhere. But if on the contrary, the disablement is of a temporary nature which merely reduces the earning capacity in any employment in which he was engaged at the time of the accident nature, the disablement is of a permanent, or even if the disablement does no more than to reduce his earning capacity in every employment which he was capable of understanding at the time of the accident, the disablement is partial and not total.',\n",

In regard to that part of the notice by which the landlord intimated the tenant that the tenancy had been terminated, although it was not disputed that that part of the notice was really a notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, the landlord was bound to wait for a period of 15 days which was the period specified in the notice and then alone could make a demand under Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act. (8) This argument was maintained to support the contention that the two notices which a landlord must issue under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act and Section 12(2) of the Bombay Rent Act could not be issued simultaneously or by one and the same document but that there should be two independent notices one following the other. (12) That it is hardly necessary for the landlord to wait in that way is clear from the fact that whereas a notice under the Transfer of Property Act is necessary to bring about the termination of the relationship of landlord and tenant, the notice under the Rent Act has for its object given a notice so that he may have an opportunity to pay the rent within the period specified in Section 12(2) of the Rent Act. But if the tenancy does not subsist but has come to an end by an process known to law and the tenant is in possession because he is a statutory tenant enjoying the protection afforded to him under a law like the Bombay Rent Act, it is manifest, as can be seen even from the pronouncement in Punjalal's case, that a determination of the tenancy by a notice under the Transfer of Property Act would hardly be necessary.\",\n",

The trial court by its judgment and order dated August 24, 1989 rejected their application on the ground that the preliminary decree had already been passed and specific shares of the parties had been declared and, thus, it was not open to the unmarried daughters to claim share in the property by virtue of the State amendment in the 1956 Act. It is true that final decree is always required to be in conformity with the preliminary decree but that does not mean that a preliminary decree, before the final decree is passed, cannot be altered or amended or modified by the trial court in the event of changed or supervening circumstances even if no appeal has been preferred from such preliminary decree.',\n",

In dealing with the question referred by the Commissioner of Income-tax whether the income received by the son should be regarded as his individual income or as the income of a Hindu undivided family for the purpose of assessment to super-tax under the Indian Income-tax Act, the Bombay High Court held that the expression \"\"Hindu undivided family\"\" as used in the Income-tax Act includes families consisting of a sole surviving male member and female members entitled to maintenance, and the income of the assessee should therefore be treated as the income of a Hindu undivided family. was carried in appeal to the Judicial Committee, the Board regarded themselves as bound by the interpretation of the words \"\"Hindu undivided family\"\" employed in the Indian Income-tax Act in the case of Kalyanji Vithaldas (5 I.T.R. and observed that since the facts of the case were not in any material respect different from the facts in the earlier case, the answer to the question referred should be that \"\"the income received by right of survivorship by the sole surviving male member of a Hindu undivided family can be taxed in the hands of such male member as his own individual income for the purpose of assessment to super-tax under s. 55 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922.\"\"',\n",

If a charge is brought such as in this case and persisted in till the stage of evidence and arguments it cannot be said that there is no reasonable excuse for the wife to refuse to come back to the husband It seems to me that the stand of the husband is inconsistent. On the one hand he is claiming a decree for restitution of conjugal rights and on the other he is making an imputation of illicit relations with Nayyar.

Clearly therefore, on the express words of s. 14(1) of the Hindu Succession Act, Kishan Devi acquired on June 17, 1956, rights of full ownership in the interest which Hukam Singh had in the property of the family during his life time, and she was competent without the consent of the male members of the family to sell the property for her own purposes. But Mr. Chatterjee for the appellants submits that under the Benares School of the Mitakshara a male coparcener is not entitled to alienate even for value his undivided interest in coparcenary property without the consent of the other coparceners, unless the alienation be for legal necessity, or if the coparcener is the father, for payment by him of his antecedent debts which are not illegal or avvavaharika, and it could not have been intended by Parliament to confer upon a widow in a Hindu family a larger right than the right which the surviving coparceners could exercise at the date of the sale by the widow. Counsel says that the Parliament by Act 30 of 1956 merely intended to confer upon a Hindu widow rights of full ownership in the interest in property in which she had prior to that Act, only a limited interest, but did not intend to destroy the essential character of joint family property so as to invest the widow with power to alienate that interest without the assent of the coparceners of her husband. A male member of a Hindu family governed by the Benaras School of Hindu Law is undoubtedly subject to restrictions qua alienation of his interest in the joint family property but a widow acquiring an interest in that property by virtue of the Hindu Succession Act is not subject to any such restrictions.\",\n",

On the view we are taking as regards the consequential effect of the extension of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 to the territories of the former State of Travancore by virtue of Part-B States (Laws) Act, 1951, it is not necessary to examine this challenge to the constitutional validity of the rules laid down in the Travancore Christian Succession Act, 1092 and we do not therefore propose to refer to them in detail, as that would be a futile exercise and would unnecessarily burden the judgment. It will thus be seen that so far as Indian Christians are concerned, Chapter II of Part V contains rules relating to intesate succession and a fortiori on the extension of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 to Part State of Travancore Cochin, the rules relating to intestate succession enacted in Chapter II of Part V would be applicable equally to Indian Christians in the territories of the former State of Travancore.

But apparently the attention of the learned Judge was not drawn to the observation in the Full Bench case as there is no reference to it in his judgment. No doubt, in Oudh, a Bench of that Court has taken a contrary view, but the Oudh Court was not bound to follow the opinion expressed by the Full Bench of this Court; and further, in Oudh., the difficulty of a wife insisting on the previous payment of an unreasonably high dower, which is beyond the means of her husband, does not at all arise, for under Section 5, Oudh Laws Act, the Courts of Oudh have power to reduce the amount of the dower debt if it is \"excessive with reference to the means of her husband,\" though in fact agreed upon. I would accordingly be most reluctant to take a view contrary to that held by the Subordinate Judge, but as it is not only a mere question of a right to property but of compelling the defendant to go and live with her husband against her will, when there may possibly be an apprehension of danger to her life or person, it is our duty to examine the evidence afresh, and satisfy ourselves that the finding of the Court below is correct. The points to which the learned Subordinate Judge has not attached due weight or which he has altogether overlooked are the following: (a) When the question is of the husband\\'s cruel, treatment towards his wife, evidence of a large number of witnesses cannot be expected to be forthcoming, and much will depend on the statement of the wife corroborated by the circumstantial evidence, particularly when the cruelty is alleged to have taken place inside the house of her husband.',\n",

Supplementing the submissions of the learned APP for the State, Mr. Sidharth Luthra, the learned Senior Counsel for the complainant refers to the judgments of the Supreme Court in Malleshi v. State of Karnataka (2004) 8 SCC 95 and Vinod v. State of Haryana (2008) 2 SCC 246 to emphasize that the offence under Section 364A IPC is contemplated to be a continuing offence which can be committed even after the murder of the person kidnapped for ransom. Even if one were to proceed on the footing that the school leaving certificate showing the date of birth of the petitioner as 20 th January 1985 should alone be taken to be the relevant piece of evidence for determining the age of the petitioner as on the date of the commission of the offence, after the judgment of the Supreme Court in Vimal Chadha it is no longer open for the petitioner to contend that it is 18th January 2003 which alone is the date of the commission of the offence. The case of the prosecution is that even if the date of the murder of the complainant's son is taken to be as 18th January 2003 the ransom calls were made on 19th January 2003, 10th March 2003 and 11th March 2003.

The detention of the petitioner has been challenged on the following grounds by submitting that detention of the petitioner is illegal :- A) because Order of Preventive Detention dated 11.1.2012 passed by the District Magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar under Sub Section (3) of Section 3, of the National Security Act, 1980 and confirmed by the State Government allegedly on the Report of State Advisory Board has been passed on wholly illegal manner and in violation of statutory and mandatory provisions of the National Security Act 1980 at each and every stage and as such the same amounts to infringement of petitioner\\'s fundamental rights conferred under the Constitution of India. F) because the Central Government has failed to discharge its duty under Section 14 of the Act, 1980 in as much as it has considered petitioner\\'s Representation dated 19.1.2012 against order preventive detention with inordinate delay therefore impugned order of preventive detention is not sustainable in the eyes of law and is liable to be set aside by this Hon\\'ble Court. In reply of the above contention, it is submitted by learned A.G.A.that the District Magistrate Gautam Budh Nagar has not committed any error in passing the order of detention dated 11.1.2012 under the NSA. From the possession of the petitioner one pistol of 32 bore made in U.S.A. was recovered, from its magazine two live cartridges were also recovered, which shows that the submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the impugned order of detention has been passed on the basis of solitary incident, is having no substance because two cases of abduction firing on the police party and recovery of pistol made in U.S.A. have been considered by the detaining authority.',\n",

The test to be adopted in determining whether an act affects law and order or public order, is: Does it lead to disturbance of the current life of the community so as to amount to disturbance of the public order or does it affect merely an individual leaving the tranquility of the society undisturbed? Every infraction of law must necessarily affect order, but an act affecting law and order may not necessarily also affect the public order. An act, for instance, affecting public order may have an impact that it would affect both public order and the security of the State. The residual question to be considered is whether the detenu has to go back to detention, after it is held that the judgment of the High Court is not sustainable.',\n",

This statement in which the appellant confessed to having committed the murder of Marappa Goundan and Muthu Goundan and also inflicted injuries on Munia Goundan on the night in question, is exhibited as P. 3/A.

Learned counsel for the complainant raised the point that in view of the provisions contained in the JJ Act, no revision is maintainable against the order of rejection of bail application under Section 439 of Cr.P.C. The words \"or otherwise\" would therefore include the bail plea that is filed before the High Court as a proceeding of first instance, otherwise than as an appeal or a revision from an order of the JJ Board ( or the Children\\'s Court ) denying bail and the rule of ejusdem generis would not apply in the present case because of the very fact that the rule of ejusdem generis is attracted where a restricted meaning is given to the general word accompanying the specific word, only when intended by the legislature but herein, the word \\'otherwise\\' used by the legislature is having other proceeding apart from appeal or revision, which can also include suo moto cognizance and even deciding the petition / application as a Court of first instance.

It was held that the document was in the nature of instructions to his legal adviser with regard to the disposition of his property and that under Mahomedan law the document operated as a valid will which might be admitted to probate.

However, on the basis of the medical evidence, the defence has succeeded in establishing that he had died soon after he left his house at 8 a.m. Dr Shambhoo Sharan (PW 13) who performed the post-mortem examination of the dead body, has stated both in his report as well as in his deposition, that there was 8 ounces of undigested food in the stomach of the deceased.

It is particularly mentioned that these two appellants inflicted injuries with kirpans on the neck of the deceased.',\n",
       " 'Ordinarily, therefore, it would not be appropriate for the High Court to re-appreciate the evidence and come to its own conclusion on the same when the evidence has already been appreciated by the Magistrate as well as the Sessions Judge in appeal, unless any glaring feature is brought to the notice of the High Court which would otherwise tantamount to gross miscarriage of justice.\" It is well settled that the delay in giving the FIR by itself cannot be a ground to doubt the prosecution case. That apart, it has specifically come in the statement of the complainant that on account of the fact it being night time and on account of his having sustained grievous injuries, he was not in a position to immediately report to the police and went to the police station in the next morning. The next submission of the learned counsel for the petitioners is with respect to non-association of a person who could have been independent witness and was concededly present at the spot at the time of the alleged occurrence and, therefore, not only adverse inference is required to be drawn against the prosecution story but this fact in itself would establish and prove the falsity of the case. No doubt, I have considered the said submission and there can be no quarrel with the proposition if a material witness, who could unfold the genesis of the incident or is an essential part of the prosecution case has not, convincingly brought to the fore or where there is a gap or infirmity in the prosecution case which could have been settled or made good by examining a witness, who though available is not examined, the prosecution case can be termed to be suffering from deficiency and .',\n",

       " 'At the same time, the High Court proceeded on the basis that the accused was free to make retraction of his confession when his statement under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was recorded. The High Court furthermore noticed that oath should not have been administered to the accused but opined that the same is not of much significance but proceeded on the basis that the decisions of the Apex Court have often said that the court cannot solely rely on the retracted confession and make it a foundation for convicting the accused. \" It is also true that before a confessional statement made under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be acted upon, it must be shown to be voluntary and free from police influence and that the confessional statement made by the appelant in the instant case cannot be taken into \"account, as it suffers from serious infirmities in that (1) there is no contemporaneous record to show that the appellant was actually kept in jail as ordered on Sept. 6, 1974 by Shri R.P. Singh who recorded the so called confessional statement of the appellant did not question him as to why he was making the confession and (3) there is also nothing in the statement of the said Magistrate to show that he told the appellant that he would not be remanded to the police lock up even if he did not confess his guilt \" The purported corroborative evidence brought on record by the prosecution and as noticed by the High Court did not indicate that the appellant was guilty of commission of the offence.',\n",
       " \"Of these, No. 1.2 Sup CI/68-10 following grounds: It is submitted firstly that these statements are not confessions proper to which S. 30 of the Evidence Act can be made applicable; secondly, that as Bengali died and Noor Mohammad absconded before the trial was finally concluded against them.. their statements are not of persons jointly tried with Haroon; thirdly a confession of a co-accused is no better than accomplice evidence and just as one accomplice cannot be held to corroborate another accomplice, the confession of a co- accused cannot -also be held to be sufficient corroboration; fourthly as these confessions, were later retracted their probative value is nil; and fifthly Kashinath's previous statement cannot be used to corroborate him -as an accomplice cannot corroborate himself. These statements are not confessions recorded by a Magistrate under S. 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but are statements made in answer to a notice under S. 171-A of the Sea Customs Act. An examination of the reported decisions of the various High Courts in India indicates that the preponderance of opinion is in favour of the view that although it may be taken into consideration against a co-accused by virtue of the provisions of s. 30 of the Indian Evidence Act, its value was extremely weak and there could be no conviction without the fullest and strongest corroboration on material particulars. As pointed out by this Court in Nathu v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2) , confessions of co-accused are not evidence but if there is other evidence on which a conviction can be based, they can be referred to as lending some assurance to the verdict.\",\n",

I agree with this finding of the learned Special Judge that the statements of witnesses recorded by the Central Excise Officers under Section 47 of the Central Excise Act and who are alive cannot be treated as substantial evidence in the criminal prosecution in view of Section 9-D of the Act. The learned counsel for the appellant has pointed our that the decision of the Supreme Court in Haroom Haji v. State of Maharashtra, , which says that statements made in answer to notices under Section 171-A of the Sea Customs Act which is also a similar provision are not confessions recorded by the Magistrate under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, was not brought to the notice of the Division Bench which rendered the above judgment and therefore the judgment of the Division Bench is not correct. As I have stated above even if it is to be assumed that the accused have not accounted for some quantity of tobacco still the burden is on the prosecution to prove that the said tobacco was used in the manufacture of cigarettes and as the prosecution failed to establish by satisfactory evidence that there was clandestine manufacture of cigarettes during that period the finding of the learned trial Judge that the prosecution failed to prove the charge cannot be said to be wrong. The learned counsel for the appellant has stated that apart from the statements recorded by the Central Excise Officers under Section 14 of the Act, there is no other substantial evidence for the prosecution to prove this charge.',\n",

In the light of the specific prohibition in relation to enrolment as member and also participation in it or otherwise specified in Section 3 of the Act there cannot be any controversy that the evidence of PW.1 also would be in the nature of accomplice evidence. \" Though an accomplice is a competent witness and though a conviction may lawfully rest upon his uncorroborated testimony, yet the Court is entitled to presume and may indeed be justified in presuming in the generality of cases that no reliance can be placed on the evidence of an accomplice unless that evidence is corroborated in material particulars, by which is meant hat there has to be some independent evidence tending to incriminate the particular accused in the commission of the crime.

Learned counsel for the accused next argued that in case the prosecution argues that the facts of the present case attracts the offences under the prize chits and money circulation scheme banning Act, which is a special act, the prosecution cannot prosecute the accused for the penal offences. Reliance is further placed upon the case of Delhi administration vs Ram Singh AIR 1962 Supreme Court 63 wherein honourable Supreme Court held that when a special Act provides that the particular offence under the said Act can be investigated by special police officer only and not by any other police officer it has to be implemented. After examining various provisions of the Customs Act and the Antiquities Act, Hon'ble Delhi High Court held that the prosecution at the most could have been for the offence of Antiquities Act and not the Customs Act.\",\n",

Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the substantive period already undergone by the appellant in this case and the fact that the appellant is an old person and that he has realized the mistake committed by him and is remorseful of his conduct to the society to which he belongs and now he wants to transform himself, I am of the considered opinion that he should be given a chance to reform himself and his better contribution to the society to which he belongs to.

Suren Rai1 it would be important to remit the matter back to the Court of the Learned Sessions Judge for the limited purpose of taking evidence of non-compliance of Section 164 and 281 Cr.P.C. However, there could be stray cases in which the confessions had been recorded in full and complete compliance of the mandate of Section 164 and 281 Cr.P.C and that the confession was voluntary and truthful and no oath may have been actually administered but inspite of the same the confession was recorded in the prescribed form for recording deposition or statement of witness giving an impression that oath was administered upon the accused. We are of the considered view that it is crucial to ascertain the fact whether oath was actually administered or not on the Respondent when the statement under section 164 Cr.P.C. was recorded before we examine the relevance and the implications of the confession to the facts of the present case.

Although the Appellant claims that he had no motive to kill the deceased and that there were no eye witnesses to the incident, he has failed to explain the circumstance as to how the blood of the deceased, as supported by Exhibit 17, was found on MO VIII, Lalit Rai vs. State of Sikkim MO X and MO XI. On the disclosure made by the Appellant, recovery and seizure of the weapon of Lalit Rai vs. State of Sikkim offence MO VIII, was made by the I.O.

The post of Junior Meter Readers were created in which the petitioner was appointed and in absence of challenge to the creation of posts of Junior Meter Readers for the purpose of appointment of temporary employees such as the petitioner, the contention advanced by the petitioner that he has been downgraded is without any basis inasmuch as the petitioner was earlier working as Meter Reader in a work-charged establishment only and not in a regular establishment. By the time the writ petition was filed, more than 3 ½ years had gone by from the date of his appointment on 20.09.2014 and the petitioner had also been regularized in the meantime as Junior Meter Reader and therefore, I am of the considered opinion that even this aspect of the matter, in the attending facts and circumstances of the case, ought not to be considered at this point of time in exercise of discretionary power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.

Though at the time when the Roha factory was established or set up, about 5 or 6 employees of the Ambarnath factory were sent to Roha factory to take advantage of their expertise and experience and help set up the Roha factory, this circumstance by itself has hardly any significance in deciding as to whether in law the two factories constitute one or separate establishments. In view of these salient features found to be well established on the record, in our view, it could not be said that Roha factory only because it is owned by the respondent-Company was not a new establishment or could be treated to be a branch or department of Ambarnath factory which by itself was an establishment admittedly covered by the Act as it was an old establishment since 1921. As there is no such evidence in the present case, on the peculiar facts of this case, it is not possible to agree with the learned counsel for the appellant that Roha factory was a part and parcel of Ambarnath factory or it was an adjunct of the main parent establishment functioning at Ambarnath since 1921.

The stay of execution proceedings can be prayed for under the said provision, by a judgment debtor, only in two circumstances, viz; when he intends to file an application under Order IX Rule 13 CPC, if the decree is ex parte in nature, or where he intends to approach the appellate court, if the decree is on merits.',\n",

On behalf of the judgment debtor it was pointed out that though normally it is correct to say that the court which passed the decree has the jurisdiction to execute the decree, the moment the decree holder sought to execute such a decree against property lying outside the jurisdiction of that court, Section 39(4) of the Code was attracted and the court was obliged to transfer the decree for execution to the proper court. But when the property sought to be proceeded against, is outside the jurisdiction of the court which passed the decree acting as the executing court, there was a conflict of views earlier, some courts taking the view that the court which passed the decree and which is approached for execution cannot proceed with execution but could only transmit the decree to the court having jurisdiction over the property and some other courts taking the view that it is a matter of discretion for the executing court and it could either proceed with the execution or send the decree for execution to another court. But this conflict was set at rest by Amendment Act 22 of 2002 with effect from 1.7.2002, by adopting the position that if the execution is sought to be proceeded against any person or property outside the local limits of the jurisdiction of the executing court, nothing in Section 39 of the Code shall be deemed to authorise the court to proceed with the execution. In a case where Order XXI Rule 3 has no application, the position seems to be that if a decree holder wants to proceed against a property situate outside the jurisdiction of the court which passed the decree, he has to get the decree transferred to the appropriate court for execution on moving the executing court in that behalf.',\n",

The only question for decision is whether the courts below were right in holding that since the remedy for a personal decree was barred by time, on the date of the institution of the suit, the plaintiffs were not entitled to get such a relief even though a direction was contained in the preliminary decree that they would be entitled to file an application for realisation of the balance of the decretal amount, otherwise than out of the property sold? Where the net proceeds of any sale held under the last preceding rule are found insufficient to pay the amount due to the plaintiff, the Court, on application by him may, if the balance is legally recoverable from the defendant otherwise than out of the property sold, pass a decree for such balance.\" 378 (FB), it was observed that a provision like this namely that the plaintiff shall be at liberty to apply for a personal decree for the amount of the balance, in a decree for sale constitutes adjudication which is detrimental to the defendant and which must be regarded as awarding the plaintiff a personal decree in the event of the proceedings of the sale being insufficient. Clause 5 of the decree provided that if the money realised by the sale of the hypotheca should not be sufficient for payment in full of the amount payable to the mortgagee, he, the mortgagee, should be at liberty, where such remedy is open to him under the terms of the mortgage and is not barred by any law for the time being in force, to apply for a personal decree against the defendants for the amount of the balance.',\n",

Kirtikumar to hold that the workman was entitled to wages last drawn which was Rs. It has been contended that since the passing of the order, several pronouncements of the Apex Court and of this Court have held that the interim wages to which a workman would be entitled would be at the rate of minimum wages which are notified by the statutory authorities from time to time. ...It would thus appear that the object underlying the enacting of the provisions contained in Section 17-B is to give relief to the workman in whose favor an award of reinstatement has been passed by the Labour Court and the said award is under challenge in the High Court or this Court. The payment which is required to be made by the employer to the workman is in the nature of subsistence allowance which would not be refundable or recoverable from the workman even if the award is set aside by the High Court or this Court. In view thereof, it is directed that the respondent/workman shall be entitled to wages in terms of the order upon her filing an undertaking in this Court to the effect that in the event of this Court holding in favor of the petitioner in the main petition, the respondent/workman shall be liable to reimburse the differential between the last drawn wages and the wages which are received by her under orders of this Court to the petitioner.',\n",

However, it cannot be ignored that the Honourable Supreme Court has to consider its own powers under Article 136 of the Constitution which is extraordinary powers so as to entertain any such litigation against any such authority and the crucial question before the Court that whether an appeal can be taken to such Court against an award of such Industrial Tribunal by special leave under Article 136 of the Constitution and in fact final determination is practically against original petitioner when it is held in para 68 that where the discretion is committed to any body or a tribunal exercising quasi judicial functions which are not fettered by ordinary rule of law, the tribunal should in the absence of any provisions to the contrary be deemed to have final authority in the exercise of that discretion.

If therefore a widow who by virtue of matrimony could be inducted into the family and can claim the status of a member thereto and indeed can call for a partition and if an idot who is disqualified to be a sharer can yet be a coparcener and claim himself to be a member of the joint family, it would be hyper-technical and indeed a refinement without any fineness if it is to be said that a legitimate son born out of lawful wedlock and who is acknowledged by the father to be a Hindu, and who has rights of succession-though not under the orthodox Hindu law or under the Hindu Succession Act to the estate of his father, cannot be terminologically ?called as a member of the family of his father.

The Revenue however relies on Section 21 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954, and would say that such son born to the assessee could only claim rights of succession therein, and he cannot claim any interest in the property of the assessee as a member of an undivided Hindu family. Having thus come to the conclusion that Nicolas Sundaram belongs to the family of the assessee by reason of the treatment meted out by the assessee and his unequivocal intention and declaration to treat him as his son and as a member of the Hindu undivided family, it is for consideration whether the property in the hands of the assessee and at his disposal during the assessment years, was impressed with the character of ancestral property or should it be deemed to be the property of the assessee and liable to be assessed as was done by the Revenue.',\n",

Mr. Bhat, learned counsel for the assessee, strongly urged that it is not open to the Tribunal to sustain the assessment under section 147(b) of the Act when it has expressly stated that the reassessment made by the Income-tax Officer under section 147(a) was not valid. It was held by the Supreme Court, in that case, that it was not possible for the Tribunal to transform an action taken under section 34(1) (b) as one under section 34(1) (a) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. Mr. Bhat, however, urged that the formation of the opinion that there was an escapement either under section 147(a) or under section 147(b), should be that of the Income-tax Officer and not that of the appellate authority or that of the court and, therefore, it would be impermissible for any other authority to sustain the reopening of the assessment under section 147(b) on which the Income-tax Officer had not relied. It seems to us that these observations cannot be applied to the present case since section 14 of the U. P. Town Areas Act referred to in the above decision was a charging section and we have already held that section 147 of the Act is only a machinery provision.',\n",

But if the assessment has been reopened under Clause (a) and, on the facts relied upon, it is not possible to hold that there was any failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts, it would still be open to the Tribunal to sustain the reassessment if those facts fulfilled the requirements of Clause (b) because all that is required for the applicability of Clause (b) is that the ITO in consequence of information in his possession has reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any assessment year. On these facts it was held that it cannot be said that the assessee had fully and truly disclosed all the material facts. In view of these two decisions, the law, so far as, this court is concerned, is well settled that though the assessee may have disclosed fully the facts at the time of the original assessment, if they are found to be untrue on the basis of the material discovered later on by the assessing authority, the assessment would be liable to be reopened under Section 147(a) because in such a case the assessee failed to disclose truly all the material facts necessary for the assessment and it would not merely be a case of change of opinion.',\n",

It appears that the accused Dhan Raj was also arrested on February 4, 1997 and the recovery of the briefcase was effected. The co-accused Sanjay in the course of investigation by his confessional statement being an extra-judicial confession dated February 4, 1997 named the accused appellants as his accomplices in the murder and robbery and stated that Dhan Raj and Badal took the briefcase and wrist watch of the deceased respectively. Owing to the later confessional statement of co-accused Sanjay, the accused appellants were arrested and subsequently on the basis of the disclosure statements of the accused appellants and corroboration by Shanti Devi (PW 7), wrist-watch and the briefcase were recovered. Before discussing the admissibility of the said statement, we would refer to the landmark decision of this Court in Sharad Birdichand Sarda vs. State of Maharashtra[7] regarding circumstantial evidence, where this Court held regarding the question of the accused last seen with the deceased held that where it is natural for the deceased to be with the accused at the material time, other possibilities must be excluded before an adverse inference can be drawn.',\n",

It is contended that the complainant who was examined as PW-2, as well as PW-1, who were both said to be the alleged victims of the crime had not identified the accused before the court. It is contended that the PSI of Amruthur Police Station, examined as PW-23 who had lead the team of police men to apprehend the accused, had admittedly seized various articles including cash from the person of the accused and is said to have recovered other articles and cash from the two cars, but had not drawn up a mahazar at the spot, but had subsequently prepared a report and placed it before the CPI at Tiptur, who in turn is said to have drawn up the mahazar in his office. That the alleged apprehension of the accused and seizure of incriminating material and recoveries made cannot be said to have been established, in the absence of the proper procedure in drawing up a mahazar at the very spot that they were allegedly apprehended having been drawn up and witnessed by independent witnesses. In the instant case on hand, if we notice the speed with which the accused were nabbed and the recovery of the exact amount of cash that was taken from the victims apart from the gold finger ring and the cell phones would certainly give rise to a presumption that could be drawn against the accused as laid down by the Apex court.',\n",

Parveen Singh who was posted at PCR Van at the time of the incident has deposed before the court all the sequence of events which took place i.e. how the complainant came to him and stated that the person on motorcycle wearing police uniform was demanding money and how he pointed out towards the accused and the accused started running from the spot and how he was apprehended on the spot along with his motorcycle and how the accused started tearing the police uniform which he was wearing at that time. Although, the witness to the factum of demand of money by the accused turned hostile, but still, in my opinion, the fact of demanding of money by the accused has been proved by the prosecution, as soon after the incident, the matter was reported by the complainant to HC Deen Dayal who was present at the PCR van and it can be said to be part of the same transaction.',\n",

Counsel for the respondent State submits that if the names of the petitioners were falling in the list of 932 candidates and such list was to be excluded by the State while making appointments pursuant to the direction passed by the learned Division Bench in the case of Krishanji & others (Supra), petitioners cannot legally claim appointment by seeking writ of mandamus or direction from this Court.

In substance, when the learned Division Bench of this Court categorically directed exclusion of 932 candidates in the matter of appointment, it would not be proper for this Court to examine the contention of the individual petitioners relating to their inclusion in the list of 932 candidates, if at all they have grievances in relation to inclusion of their names in the said list.',\n",

Once the statement of the dying person and the evidence of the witnesses testifying to the same passes the test of careful scrutiny of the courts, it becomes a very important and a reliable piece of evidence and if the court is satisfied that the dying declaration is true and free from any embellishment such a dying declaration, by itself, can be sufficient for recording conviction even without looking for any corroboration. Dr. Kunjan Patel also had made an endorsement and at that time he had recorded the three names and thereafter the Executive Magistrate had recorded the dying declaration.

The petitioner also learnt that no duty need be paid on the component parts used in the fabrication and erection of turn-key projects, inasmuch as they are items purchased in the open market upon which duty has already been paid by the appropriate manufacturer, and further that the unfinished component parts which are made at the petitioner\\'s factory premises, are not \"goods\", attracting duty; the said unfinished component parts are not marketable goods, known to market.

Now coming to the facts of the case before us, duty in this case was not levied upon the value of the machinery, fabricated and erected at the site of the customers, nor at that stage. It is argued that the said decisions, at any rate, can be treated as starting point for limitation, and the present writ petitions cannot be said to be barred by limitation, it is also argued that there is no period of limitation as such prescribed for filing writ petitions, and that particularly where tax/duty has been collected in violation of Article 265 of the Constitution, this Court should ignore the pleas of limitation and should grant relief.',\n",

Mr. Chaterjee, therefore, submitted that in view of the decision of this Court, it must be held that whatever excise duty has been paid by the petitioner was by way of mistake in law and thus the question of limitation on refund as contained in Rule 11 of the Central Excise and Salt Rules as it thence stood does not arise. In this case, this Court is not concerned with the question which has been raised in the counter-affidavit that the petitioner-Company was not entitled to the benefit of the notifications as contained in Annexure-1 and 2 to the writ application, inasmuch as the Collector (Appeals) as also the Tribunal themselves have found that the petitioner is so entitled. If the petitioner made a claim of the refund of the duty alleging therein that it had made payment by mistake of law; it was the duty of the concerned authority of the Central Excise Department to consider the same on its proper prospective but it had no jurisdiction to accept it with prospective effect and reject the contention of the petitioner so far as its claim for refund is concerned.',\n",

It was next argued that the reference under Section 21 of the Chartered Accountants Act was to the High Court as a court, that a right of appeal against orders made by the High Court is conferred by Section 109 Civil Procedure Code and that on the principle that when matters are referred for the adjudication of a civil court, that will attract the normal procedure of that court including a right of appeal, an appeal would iie to the Supreme Court against the order dated 22-4-1952 and reference was made to the decisions in --\\'National Telephone Co.

From this it was sought to be argued that inasmuch as the preliminary order was passed by a criminal court the disobedience of such an order would not amount to an offence under Section 188 I. P. C. P. C. was an order the breach of which was punishable under Section 188 I. P. C. as to the parties to that order but this decision did not deal with the question of orders passed in judicial proceedings by civil, revenue or criminal courts.\" A judgment or an order passed in open court constitutes a formal declaration to the public of the decision of the court in the case in which the order is given or the judgment is passed. Even if the word \\'promulgated\\' was construed in a narrow sense of being a public declaration by an authority that a certain order had been made with respect to certain property, there was sufficient evidence in the case to show that the matter had been brought to the notice of the parties and the public in general by beat of drum that the property had been attached and handed over to the possession of Supurdar.',\n",

P. C, and the other respondents being their associates In the crime were guilty of the offence under Section 379, I. P. C., According to him, the learned Judicial Magistrate failed to construe the provisions of Section 188, I. P.

State The evidence in this case was that the preliminary order under Section 145 of the Code was promulgated by P. W. 6 in the presence of other witnesses and the subject-matter of dispute was attached. When the subject-matter of dispute was not in possession of the first party or of the second party to the proceeding under Section 145 of the Code and the same was attached by promulgation of the order dated 28-10-1973, then the question that arises for consideration is who was in possession of the subject-matter of dispute during the period the property remained under attachment. But as it was a case under Section 144 of the Code, a prohibitory order had been promulgated and there was no attachment of the subject matter of dispute, it was held that a case of theft of paddy crops could not be made out.',\n",
       " 'In the first place, it has been contended that the complaint in this case having been made by Sri Poddar, it was not a proper complaint in accordance with the terms of Section 195, Criminal P. C. The argument is based on Clause (a) of Sub-section (i) of Section 193 which provides that no Court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under Section 188, Penal Code except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned. P. C. The \\'ex parte\\' order of Injunction under Section 144 of the Code was made by Sri Poddar while functioning as the Sub-Divisional Magistrate: it was his order that was alleged to have been violated or disobeyed, and the complaint which he made was, in my view, a valid complaint, although on the date he was not functioning as the Sub-Divisional Magistrate. Mr. Mukherjee has argued that in the circumstances disclosed by the statements contained in this petition and the oral evidence in the case, the \\'ex parte\\' order of injunction was not a proper order, and as such the convictions of the petitioners are not justified. \"It is not open to the Court trying an accused person for disobedience of an order under Section 144, Criminal P. C. to decide whether he would have passed such an order in the circumstances of the case. It must of course be said that the order in the present case was made judicially by the Magistrate and it becomes a duty, I think, of the Court trying a charge of disobedience to the order of a public servant to see whether the order violated or infringed was not only made with jurisdiction but was one which was not fundamentally wrong or basically inept.',\n",
       " 'The second point which he has urged is that, in any case, the District Magistrate could not direct the Sub-divisional Magistrate to file a complaint, and that, if he was of opinion that a complaint should be filed, he should have filed it himself. Acting under Section 195 (1) (a), therefore, the District Magistrate can file a complaint for an offence under Sections 172 to 188 of the Penal Code if the public servant concerned is one of the Sub-divisional Magistrates or Magistrates under him. Mr. Jha has relied upon several decisions in support of his argument that the District Magistrate has no jurisdiction to pass any order in respect of a matter in which a Magistrate under him has refused to file a complaint. Mr. Lala Kailash Behari Prasad, who has appeared on behalf of the State, has referred me to the decision in The State v. Sudhir Ruhidas, AIR 1959 Cal 450, Guha Ray J. has held in that case that, when a Magistrate appointed under Section 12, 13 or 14 of the Code refuses to file a complaint, the District Magistrate, to whom he is subordinate is competent to file a complaint. It is abundantly clear from what I have said above that the District Magistrate could interfere in the present case, and, if he came to the conclusion, on proper consideration, that a complaint should be filed for an offence under Section 188 of the Penal Code against the petitioners, he undoubtedly had jurisdiction to file such a complaint.',\n",
       " 'Despite the absence of express provision like that in Sub-section (6) of Section 12 of the Indian Bar Councils Act, the High Courts have all along been exercising the power to direct the reinstatement of a pleader dismissed under Section 13 of the Legal Practitioners Act in view of his subsequent rehabilitation regarding the power as an inherent power. We should think that the power inheres in the disciplinary jurisdiction vested in the High Court by Sections 12 and 13 of the Legal Practitioners Act rather than in the jurisdiction to make rules for admission to the profession conferred by Section 6. That being so we are of the view that Section 55 of the Advocates Act preserves this power of the High Court notwithstanding the repeal of Sections 12 and 13 of the Legal Practitioners Act by Section 50 (4) of the Advocates Act with effect from 1-9-1963 on which date Chapter V of that Act came into force. The misconduct for which the petitioner herein was dismissed was so grave that we do not think that he should be readmitted to the profession. He was found guilty of having appeared for an accused person in a criminal case without any authority, on a forged vakalath, and with having pleaded guilty on behalf of the accused, paid the fine imposed, and obtained an order for the release of a motor lorry belonging to the accused which had been seized by the police in pursuance of which order the lorry was delivered to a rival claimant.',\n",

Now, in the present case, the provisions of Sections 24 and 25 of the Bombay Pleaders Act are being invoked against Shri M and normally, this Court would not have jurisdiction in view of the repeal of the said provisions. However, the said provisions of the Bombay Pleaders Act are saved to the extent mentioned in Section 55 of the Advocates Act, in so far as pleaders and vakils practising as such immediately before the date on which Chapter IV came into force, and notwithstanding the repeal of the said provisions of the Pleaders Act, such pleader or vakil continued to enjoy the same rights as respects practice in any court or revenue office or before any authority or person and be subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the same authority which he enjoyed, or as the case may be, to which he was subject immediately before the said date and accordingly the relevant provisions of the Acts or law aforesaid shall have effect in relation to such person as if they had not been repealed. It would thus appear that Shri M, who has been admittedly practising as a pleader since before Chapter IV of the Advocates Act came into force, will be subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the High Court. He submitted that having regard to the stigma which he has been already carrying on account of his conviction, he is unable to get any practice worth the name and if a serious view is taken, and if he loses his right to practice, his family would be ruined.',\n",
       " 'The argument of the learned Deputy Government Advocate in reply is that there is nothing in the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, to suggest that the provisions of Section 409, I.P.C., have been repealed impliedly by Section 5(1)(c) of the Act & that if a public servant is alleged to have committed an offence which falls either under Section 5(l)(c) of the Act or under Section 409, Penal Code, he is under Section 26, General Clauses Act, liable to be prosecuted and punished under either of these enactments. It is further argued by the learned Government Advocate that the matter has been now set at rest by the Prevention of Corruption (Second Amendment) Act, 1952, by which Sub-section (4) of Section 5 of the principal Act was amended so as to make it clear that the provisions of Section 5 are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other law for the time being in force and nothing contained therein exempts any public servant from any proceeding which might, apart from Section 5 be instituted against him. Clause (c) of Section 5(1) which makes the act of a public servant of dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriating or otherwise converting for his own use any property entrusted to him or under his control as a public servant or allowing any other person so to do, a criminal misconduct is not different from Section 409, Penal Code, in so far as it relates to an offence by a public-servant. The question whether Section 5(1)(c) of the Act virtually repeals Section 409, Penal Code in relation to public servants is now concluded by the new Sub-section (4) of Section 5 of the Act which says that the provisions of that section are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any law for the time being in force and that nothing in that section shall exempt any public servant from any proceeding which might be instituted against him. The fact that the trial of a public servant for an offence under Section 5(2), Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, the object of which is to prevent effectively bribery and corruption on the part of public servants, can only be with the sanction of the appropriate authority and the sanctioning authority is required to exercise its discretion in giving sanction on the facts and circumstances of each case and the fact that in a trial for that offence the stringent rule laid down in Section 5(3) as to presumption against the accused is to be applied, far from indicating an implied repeal of Section 409, Penal Code, only emphasises the fact that the operation of the general criminal law is not excluded.',\n",

In that document he complained to the Panchayat Officer that he was overburdened with work, and also incidentally mentioned that the money, which had been taken out, could not be put in the safe, and was at his house. This matter was considered at length by the Punjab High Court in Gurucharan Singh's case (A),' and it was held that there was repeal by implication of Section 409 so far it related to public servants, by Section 5 (1) (c), Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. Further it seems to us that it is not possible to hold that Section 409, Penal Code is repealed by necessary implication by Section 5(1)(c), of Prevention of Corruption Act, even though there are some differences as pointed out in Gurcharan Singh's case (A)', particularly to view of the amendment which was made in August, 1952. In that case, the two offences were under the same law, namely the Penal Code, and Section 26, General Clauses Act, 1897 did not apply to the facts of that case.\",\n",

Going over to the third contention it may be pointed out that it is not incumbent on the prosecution to examine every one of the persons who were present at the time of the payment and no inference adverse to the prosecution can be drawn on account of the omission of examining George Pedro on record, A suggestion was made that the evidence of Kashiram (P.W. The offence is said to have been committed on or about 15-3-1950 and the challan was filed on 25-6-1951, In this case, therefore it is only the Question of the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, that arises and the provisions of the further amendment in 1952 of this Act need not be considered. In the case on hand the very same argument as is found in para 8 of the above Allahabad decision was advanced in this Court that the accused was prejudiced by the prosecution Under Section 5 (1) (c). In view of the voluminous decisions, the view taken by the Punjab High Court must be dissented from land I find that the prosecution of the applicant J Under Section 409, IPC was not bad in law and that the applicant cannot be held to have been prejudiced by such prosecution.\",\n",

Where, however, the offence is one which was punishable under the Penal Code and is now made punishable under this Act also, the question arises whether it is open to the prosecution to proceed against the accused under the general law, that is under the Penal Code, or under the special provisions contained in this Act. \"In the face of the amendment made in Section 5, Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947, by the substitution of a new Sub-section (4) in place of the old one by the amending Act, 59 of 1952, it cannot be argued that the operation of that Act, in the case of a public servant, excludes the operation of Section 409, Penal Code.

Where penal interest is levied under section 215 by the order or assessment, the assessee may altogther deny his liability to pay such interest on the ground that he was not liable to pay advance tax at all or that the amount of advance tax determined by the Income-tax Officer as payable ought to be reduced. Similarly, where interest is levied under section 139 of the Act, the assessee may deny his liability to pay such interest on the ground that the return was not belated or that the penal provision was not attracted at all to his case.

Where the assessee received some amount as a liability, which was not claimed as deduction or expenses in any of the years, and the same was written off as compensation/damages for relinquishment of right to sue in court of law, the provisions of section 41(1) or section 68 would not apply to the writing off that liability.',\n",

The question, however, is whether such a court an d the presiding officer of such a court can be said to hold a post in the judicial service of the State as defined in Article 236 of the Constitution.

In Delhi Judicial Service Association, Tis Hazari Court, Delhi v.

In the Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal\\'s case (supra), the Supreme Court referring to the aforesaid decisions held (paragraphs 11 and 12 of the judgment) that it was a consistent view of the Supreme Court that it had power under Article 129 to punish not merely for contempt of itself, but also for contempt of all Courts and Tribunals subordinate to it and that there can be no doubt that the Court had jurisdiction to punish for the 1 contempt of the Income-Tax Appellate Tribunal.

As it is a special appointment given for a particular period till the drought and scarcity conditions are over, therefore, the observations made by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sanjeet Rai's case are applicable only so far as the payment of wages to the workers is concerned and, in our view, it will not be applicable in the employment.\",\n",

Thus, from the documents filed by the respondent, it stands well established that he was appointed in the Relief Section of the Collectorate, Churu for the famine relief works and that he was positively not appointed in the Rehabilitation Section of the Collectorate. Thus, the respondent suppressed this material fact in the writ petition and wrongly pleaded that he was appointed as a daily rated LDC in the Rehabilitation Section of the Collectorate, Churu and on account of this, the learned single Judge as well as the learned Division Bench were misled and it was wrongly assumed that the petitioner\\'s services continued for more than 240 days even before October 3, 1988 in the Rehabilitation Section of the Collectorate.

We may add that whenever any construction work is being carried out either departmentally or through contractors, the Government or any other governmental authority including a public sector corporation which is carrying out such work must take great care to see that the provisions of the labour laws are being strictly observed and they should not wait for any complaint to be received from the workmen in regard to non-observance of any such provision before proceeding to take action against the erring officers or contractors, but they should institute an effective system of periodic inspections coupled with occasional surprise inspections by the higher officers in order to ensure that there are no violations of the provisions of labour laws and the workmen are not denied the rights and benefits to which they are entitled under such provisions and if any such violations are found, immediate action should be taken against defaulting officers or contractors.\" We are only concerned with the fifth respondent being a State instrument authority while parting their own provision or which are to be engaged by the contractors securing itself by such conditions which will not bring any future liability on that account various claims made under the P.F.Act and also seeing that such labour laws are not violated by the future contractors employed by them.',\n",

After investigation, the charge-sheet came to be filed only against six accused persons by deleting some of the provisions of Sections 317, 365, 368, 392, 420, 465, 468, 470, 471, 109 and Section 80 of the J.J.

Once, when both the Courts held that the prosecution failed to establish the offence under Section 81 of the Act against A-5 and A-6, A-7 and A-8 the question of selling the said infant female baby by the accused/A-1 does not arise therefore he is also entitled for acquittal. Therefore it is the defence of the accused that A-1, A-7 and A-8 had no intention to sell the infant baby and that they have not committed any offence and are entitled for acquittal. Merely because, the baby and cash were found with the A-1, the trial Court invoked the provision under Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act holding that the A-1 has failed to explain the position of the baby and the cash with her. The other links of the circumstantial evidence is that A-7 and A-8 are the parents of the baby trying to sell the baby to her are not proved as they were acquitted by the trial Court.',\n",
       " 'The order passed on 6th January, 1939, is clearly an order directing execution to proceed on the footing that the decree was one capable of being executed by the Court in which the execution petition had been filed. The learned Judges support themselves by these observations in laying down the principle that when an order for execution of a decree is made, the implication is that the appellant has a right to execute the decree; that it is an executable decree, that it is not barred by limitation and that the judgment-debtor is liable to satisfy it. To put the matter from another point of view, it is only when a Judge or Court has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the proceeding or action in which an order is made or a judgment rendered, that such order or judgment is wholly void, and that the maxim applies that consent cannot give jurisdiction; in all other cases, this objection to the exercise of the jurisdiction may be waived, and is waived, when not taken at the time the exercise of the jurisdiction is first claimed, Hobart v. Frost (1856)5 Duer N.Y. 672, Black on Judgments, Section 217. From this it follows that the absence of an order of transfer is merely an irregularity in the assumption of jurisdiction by the Tenali Sub-Court when proceedings were commenced in it, but that objection not having been taken in the first instance, the judgment-debtor (the appellant ) must be held to have waived it. If both the Courts arc situated in the same district, seeing that the transfer might be made directly from the first Court to the second Court, without the intervention of any superior Court, it may be said that the objection by reason of the language of Section 38 or, in other words, by reason of the irregularity that the decree had not been formally sent to the second Court which has territorial jurisdiction is not fatal to the competency of the second Court to pass the order.',\n",
       " \"The appellant argues that there has been no express decision that the application of 1922 was in time, and in the absence of an express decision to that effect the principle of constructive res judicata should not be applied to it. The implication of that order is that the applicant has a right to execute the decree and that it is an executable decree and that it is not barred by limitation, and that the judgment debtor is liable to satisfy the decree. It is next urged that notice of the application of 1922 was not served upon the appellant and therefore the order on that petition could not bind him. 83, it was held that an order' in execution proceedings cannot operate as res judicata when notice has not been ordered to the judgment debtor. When no notice is given to the judgment-debtor or when the notice does not specify what is going to be done, any order passed on the execution application will not operate as res judicata in subsequent proceedings.\",\n",

Pointing out the other allegations in the complaint to the effect that the accused made false representation knowing fully well it was false so as to induce the complainant to deliver the goods; that, but for their representation, the goods would not have been delivered to them; and that, after committing the offence, the accused, who are close relatives, have vacated their usual place of residence and shifted elsewhere; learned counsel states that, with the above general allegations, the petitioner also has been unnecessarily roped in and that even if those allegations and averments are accepted as true, the ingredients of Sections 120B, 409 and 420 IPC. .............., that in a case of goods sold on credit, the moment, the buyer gets the goods, he becomes the owner and the seller looses his title on the goods and if at all, the seller is entitled to only for the money due on it, for that if at all the seller is entitled, to proceed as per the agreement and the said transaction cannot be labelled as \"criminal breach of trust\". may not be made out in view of the reason that it is a case of admitted sale and that though it is a continuos transaction which took place between 2001-2002 and initial payment has been made, however, offences under Sections 120B and 420 IPC.

Spencer, J., observes: \"I am, with due respect, inclined to think that the words \\'on receiving an application for the execution of a decree\\' in Rule 17 were not intended to make a party suffer, for the failure of the Court establishment, which checks plaints and execution petitions on their presentation to at once notice all defects in any application that may be received and that these words do not preclude a Court from making an order allowing a defect to be remedied at a later stage.\" In the present case, too, there is no question of suffering for the failure of the establishment, because the petitioner knew all along that his application was defective, and remedied that defect on his own initiative. ), that the Munsif had no jurisdiction in 1923 to order the defect to be remedied, but even allowing in the light of Vemuri Pitchayya v.

The learned judges held, dissenting from the view of the Calcutta High Court,, that the amendment related back to the date of the original petition. 699 is not an authority to the contrary; the case merely decided that where the lower Court declined to pass a remedial order under Order 21, Rule 17(1), there was no refusal of jurisdiction and the High Court was not bound to interfere in revision.

It became an effective application only when the legal representatives of Kannappa including the appellant were brought on record, and as this was done on the 27th October, 1943, more than twelve years after the date of the decree, no order for execution should be passed on the application. In that case the naming of a deceased judgment-debtor as the person against whom execution is sought was regarded as no more than a mistake in giving the particulars required under Section 235 of the Old Code corresponding to Order 21, Rule 11(2) of the present Code. 76., where, as already observed, the mention of the name of the deceased judgment-debtor as the person against whom relief in execution is sought was regarded as a matter for amendment under Order 21, Rule 17.\",\n",

Mr.V.Bharathidasan, learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the court below erred in allowing the application without considering the fact that the application filed by the decree holders is barred by limitation; that the 4th respondent in the execution petition died on 24.11.1997 but the present application to implead his LRs was filed after a period of 12 years from the date of the judgment in the second appeal; that the present application is not maintainable as the second appeal was dismissed on 15.04.1998 and that pending the appeal, the 4th respondent died on 24.11.1997 but the EP was filed on 30.03.2004 against the dead person. On the other hand, Shri V.Radhakrishnan, learned Senior Counsel for the respondents would submit that originally the suit was dismissed by the trial court on 16.02.1983 however the appeal filed by the plaintiff was allowed on 27.04.1984. The Division Bench, following the judgment reported in 1893 (4) MLJ 8 = ILR 17 MAD 76 in the case of Samia Pillai vs. Chockalingam Chettiar has held that for the mistake of entering the name of the deceased judgment debtor in the execution application, as a party against whom execution was sought was only a bonafide mistake. In this state of the authorities we are inclined to follow the decision in Samia Pillai v. Chockalinga Chettiar, where, as already observed, the mention of the name of the deceased judgment -debtor as the person against whom relief in execution is sought was regarded as a matter for amendment under Order 21 Rule 17.',\n",
       " \"It was contended on behalf of the decree-holder before the executing Court that the application filed on behalf of Balwantsingh and Dalpatsingh setting aside the sale under Order 21, Rule 19 was barred by limitation, the period prescribed for such an application under Article 166 of the Limitation Act being 30 days from the date of the sale. The Collector filed an objection on 11-9-1955 on behalf of Balwantsingh and Dalpatsingh that the execution application should be dismissed as the legal representatives of Askaransingh had not been impleaded. On 8-7-57, the Collector filed another objection on behalf of the minors seeking to get the execution application dismissed on the ground that the legal representatives of Askaransingh had not been impleaded when it was filed and that it was barred by limitation. Shrimati Moong Kanwar was the only member of the family who was left alive on the death of Askaransingh, But for the adoption of the appellants' father (which took place on 26-6-1951, according to the copy of the registered adoption deed which has been filed) Shrimati Moong Kanwar would have been the legal representative of Askaransingh being the widow of a pre-deceased son. The argument put forward on behalf of the appellants is that the execution application dated 19-5-1951 which was in accordance with law, became a nullity on 6-4-1952 on the death of Askaransingh as his legal representatives were not impleaded.\",\n",
       " '546/1957 was not a step in aid of execution, that the factum of the death of the judgment-debtor was known to the decree-holder at that time and that all the legal representatives were not impleaded.. The only point for consideration in this revision is whether the application for execution i.e., E. A. No- 546/1957 filed on 17-7-1957 was an application for execution in accordance with law; if not whether it was a step in aid of the execution of the decree. A single Judge of that Court dissented from the view taken in ILR 17 Mad 76 and came to the conclusion that an application for execution against a deceased judgment-debtor was neither an application for execution made in accordance with law nor could it be treated as an application for a step in aid of execution. That Court has further held that an execution petition filed against a deceased judgment-debtor was not a nullity, but was a step in aid of execution of the decree. We therefore follow the principle of that decision and hold that the application for execution dated 17-7-1957 was a step in aid of execution, that the subsequent application was within time, and that the order passed by the lower Court is right.',\n",
       " 'The Court below has held that the application was barred by time because it was not made within three years of any application made in accordance with law or any proper step taken in aid of execution, In the first place, we must point out that there has been a misapprehension in treating the application of 15th December 1928 and an application for execution. It is impossible to hold that if an application for execution is not an application in accordance with law, having been against a parson who is dead, it is nevertheless a good application to take some steps-in-aid of execution against the deceased. We are therefore of opinion that an application for the transfer of the execution of a decree made at a time when the judgment-debtor is dead is a valid application to take steps-in-aid of execution. Differing from the view taken in Calcutta and Madras and following the ruling of our own Court, we must hold that this application for execution which was not in accordance with law did not amount to an application for taking steps-in-aid of execution. The present application not being within three years of any order on any application in accordance with law for execution or on any valid application for taking step-in-aid of execution, is barred by time.',\n",
       " \"Ram Kali v. Sir Bhadarman', AIR 1934 All 463 (J) and -- 'Gulab-singh v. Nathu', AIR 1944 Nag 145 (K), have taken a contrary view and held that execution against a dead judgment-debtor was a nullity and that the question as to whether the decree-holder filed that execution petition in good faith or not was wholly immaterial. The question is whether the mention of the name of a dead judgment-debtor in an application under Order 21, Rule 11, Civil P. C. would be a material defect so as to make the application not one in accordance with law unless it is properly amended and aid is sought for from Order 21, Rule 17 (2). In that view therefore the execution petition mentioning the name of a deceased judgment-debtor cannot be held to be a nullity even if it be held to be not in accordance with law on account of non-compliance with the provisions of Order 21, Rules 11 and 17 (2). The Nagpur and Allahabad High Courts have pointed out how the first part of Clause 5 of Article 182, Limitation Act would be rendered practically nugatory if an application for execution which is held to be not in accordance with law as laid down in Order 21, Rule 11 is yet held to be a step-in-aid of execution-within the meaning of the second part of that clause. But I find that in AIR 1934 Lah 55 (I), it was held that an application for execution filed against a deceased judgment-debtor and subsequently withdrawn was a step-in-aid within the meaning of Article 182, Limitation.\",\n",
       " 'The question for decision, therefore, is whether the last application for execution made on the 14th of May, 1943, against Lachhman Mandal, who had died earlier on the 13th July, 1942, was in accordance with law within the meaning of Clause (5) of Article 182 of the Limitation Act so as to amount to a step-in-aid of an execution sufficient to prevent the present application for execution being time barred. In the present appeal, Mr. S.C. Mazumdar, appearing for the appellants, has contended that the application of the 14th May, 1943, being against a dead person was not in accordance with law, and, therefore, it cannot amount even to a step-in-aid of execution within the meaning of Article 182 (5) of the Act. Mr. Justice Choudhary held that the decisions of this Court, namely, Gobardhan Das Dwarka Prasad v. Satish Chandra Rai, ILR 1 Pat 609: (AIR 1922 Pat 597)(A), and, Jogendra Prasad v. Mangal Prasad, 7 Pat LT 330: (AIR 1926 Pat 160) (B), on old Clause (6) of Article 182, were applicable to a case governed by the amended Clause (5) of Article 182, with this difference that the starting point for fresh limitation will be the date of, the final order passed on an application for issue of a notice under Order XXI, Rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure, instead of the date on which the order for issue of such notice was passed, and, therefore, his Lordship held that the present application was within time, because the previous application, on which a notice under Order XXI, Rule 22 of the Civil Procedure Code was issued, was an application to take some step-in-aid of execution of the decree under execution. In the present case, it is not denied that the application was presented by the party entitled to execute the decree in order to obtain the execution, but it is contended that, as the sole judgment-debtor was dead at the time, and still he was named as the party against whom the execution was sought, the application must be treated a nullity, and, consequently, the present application held to be time barred. My concluded opinion, therefore, in the present case, is that the application for execution made by the decree-holder on the 14th May, 1943, filed against the deceased judgment-debtor, in ignorance of his death, having been admitted under Order XXI, Rule 17 (4) of the Code, and, the execution court having ordered execution of the decree and taken steps thereon by issuing a notice under Order XXI, Rule 22, Code of Civil Procedure, although it could not he acted upon was nevertheless an application in accordance with law to take a step in-aid of the execution of the decree within Article 182 (5) of the Act, and, therefore, the present execution was not time barred.',\n",

Ltd (supra), but to find out the correct facts with regard to the nature of amount outstanding at the end of the year, i.e. whether amounts outstanding is on account of advance received from customers for trading activity or it was on account of capital financing by the AE to decide the issue of allowability of mark to market loss on foreign exchange fluctuation; hence, we set aside the issue to the file of the AO and direct him to verify the facts with regard to the claim of the assessee that loss occurred on account of re-statement of advance received is on account of trading activity.\",\n",

(3) Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case and in law, the Tribunal was right in holding that payment of employees contribution to PF/ESI/pension fund is subject to provisions of section 43B of the Act ?

Narain Bai might be supported on the special facts of that case, but that some of the general observations, which were not necessary for the decision, could not be supported. In this case all that was necessary for the respondent to show was that the applications of June 2, 1925, and July 8, 1926, were made in accordance with law to the proper Court for execution, or to take some step in aid of execution of the decree. To hold that it was necessary for the Court to be satisfied that the said applications were made bona fide and that the decree-holder had the intention of proceeding to execution in pursuance of each of the said applications would be to import words into the terms of the article which are not to be found therein and would necessitate the Court embarking upon the difficult and in some cases impossible task of finding the motive of the decree-holder in making the applications. It is to be noted that by the said article, before amendment, the date of the application for execution was the time from which the period of limitation was to run, and it was not until the amending Act of 1927 was passed that the result of the application, viz., the final order passed on the application, became the material time.',\n",
       " 'It is contended that section 7 (1)(c) of the Act, under which the impugned order has been made, cannot be saved by clause (2) of article 19 of the Constitution, because it does not relate to any matter which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State. There can be no doubt that to impose pre-censorship on a journal, such as has been ordered by the Chief Commissioner in this case, is a restriction on the liberty of the press which is included in the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitu- tion, and the only question which we have therefore to decide is whether clause (2) of article 19 stands in the way of the petitioners. The East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, of which sec- tion 7 is a part, was passed by the Provincial Legislature in exercise of the power conferred upon it by section 100 of the Government of India Act, 1935, is read with Entry 1 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to that Act, which includes among other matters \"public order.\" It was argued that \"public safety\" and \"maintenance of public order\" are used in the Act disjunctively and they are separated by the word \"or\" and not \"and,\" and therefore we cannot rule out the possibility of the Act providing for ordinary as well as serious cases of disturbance of public order and tranquillity. We therefore cannot ignore the fact that preservation of public safety is the dominant purpose of the Act and that it is a special Act providing for special measures and therefore it should not be confused with an Act which is applicable to ordinary situations and to any and every trivial case of breach of public order, In my opinion, the word \"or\" is used here not so much to separate two wholly different concepts as to show that they are closely allied concepts and can be used almost inter- changeably in the context.',\n",
       " 'As regards the assent of the President it was urged that the Court while examining this question should look to the contents of the Ordinance and if it is discovered that the Ordinance was promulgated by the Governor in the exercise of his legislative power under Entry No. These observations of the learned Judges of the Patna High Court in view of the later decision of the Supreme Court in AIR 3959 SC 308, are no longer a good law. The question before the Supreme Court in the above case was whether the validity of the law could be examined by the Court on the ground that it was a colourable legislation and it was in that context that their Lordships observed as follows: The motive with which the Ordinance is promulgated is, therefore, quite irrelevant and cannot be looked into by the Court if it is of opinion that the Governor has acted within his legislative competence under Article 213 of the Constitution. The validity of the Ordinance is also questioned on the ground that the assent of the President was not obtained especially when the parent Act which stands amended by the Ordinance was assented to by the President, It is argued that the Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act, 1959, was enacted with the assent of the President, and, therefore, it can be amended by such law which has also received the assent of the President.',\n",

Thus the primary question which requires consideration is, whether the impugned legislation which apparently seems to be in conflict with the fundamental right enunciated in article 19 (1) (d) of the Consitution is protected by clause (5) of the article, under which a law would be valid if it imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right in the interests of the general public. Coming now to the provisions of the impugned Act, Mr. Baner- jee\\'s main contention is that section 4 (1) (c)of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, which provides for passing of orders removing a person from a particular area, on the satisfaction of the Provincial Government or the District Magistrate, cannot be a reasonable piece of legislation inasmuch as the only pre-requisite for imposition of the restrictions is the personal satisfaction of certain indi- viduals or authorities, the propriety or reasonableness of which cannot be tested by the application of any external rule or standard. \"When an order has been made in respect of any person under any of the clauses under section 4, sub-section (1), or sub-section (2) the grounds of it may be communicated to him by the authority making the order and in any case, when the order is to be in force for more than three months, he shall have a right of making a representation which shall be referred to the Advisory Tribunal, constituted under section 3, sub-section (4).\"',\n",

Insofar the contention of learned counsel for the appellants with regard to order dated 28.5.2019 having been passed by the respondent no.2 without jurisdiction, we have noticed that the appellants themselves have submitted to his jurisdiction inasmuch as in the earlier two writ petitions, they have categorically prayed that the enquiry to be conducted by the respondent no.2, should be in accordance with principles of natural justice. Similarly, the contention of Shri Hora with regard to applicability of the provisions of Section 16 of the Act of 2005, is without any factual foundation nor, can be entertained in this intra court appeal for the first time (9 of 9) [SAW-1680/2019] wherein it has already been held that the election dated 28.10.2018 was void ab initio.',\n",

There is, however, also a letter purportedly from the Bar Council of India dated 27.8.2003 addressed to the Bar Council of Delhi to the effect that the process of election of the nominee member of Bar Council of Delhi in the Bar Council of India was not valid and as such the election of Shri Jatan Singh cannot be taken cognizance of and that Bar Council of Delhi ought to follow the procedure in this regard. That being the case, in point of fact, Mr. Aggarwala was not a member of the Bar Council of Delhi on the date (i.e. 20.9.2003) on which he passed the impugned order staying the entire election. As he was not a member of the Bar Council of Delhi as Mr. Jatan Singh had been elected in his place, he could not also be a member of the Bar Council of India. Therefore, even if it is assumed that Mr. Aggarwala was the Vice Chairman of the Bar Council of India on the date on which he passed the impugned order, it could not be said that it was passed under the direction of the Chairman, Bar Council of India.',\n",

In the present case, the Vice Chancellor has exercised the powers of initiating disciplinary enquiry and suspending the petitioner on 7.12.2008 as emergency measure for the reasons that the petitioner was involved in a criminal case in which a charge sheet was submitted; he was not doing teaching work and had disobeyed the orders of the Head of the Department.

They concurred with the finding of the Subordinate Judge that the judgment-debtor prevented the execution of the decree within 12 years by fraudulent concealment of his ownership of the 'Prabhat' newspaper and that the twelve years' bar of limi- tation did not apply; but they held that the application was barred under article 182 of the Limitation Act, as more than three years had run from 9th September, 1940, the date of the dismissal of the previous execution application, before the present application was filed on 4th October, 1946. The fact that the decree-holder in the lower courts relied on section 48, Civil Procedure Code, only does not prevent him from relying on section 18 of the Limitation Act if the facts necessary to be established for bringing in the assistance of section 18 of the Limitation Act are admitted, or proved. According to the appellant, fraud even with reference to one property gives him a further extension of 12 years under section 48 (2) as regards the whole decree and it is not necessary for him to show that he had proceeded against the other properties of the judgment-debtor. Affirmatively, by the inclu- sion of section 18 in the Limitation Act, and, negatively, by not providing for a separate period of limitation in the case of the fraud of the judgment-debtor in the third column in the articles, the Legislature has clearly indicated that unless advantage could be taken by the decree-holder under section 18 on the ground of the fraud of the judgment-debtor, fraud does not give any other relief under the Limitation Act.\",\n",

S52 and is signed and delivered at such time and place and in such circumstances as to lead legitimately to the conclusion that, so far as the deposit is concerned, it constitutes the agreement between the parties.\" No doubt it was taken by the respondents to show that the title deeds of the appellant\\'s properties were deposited with them as security for the moneys advanced by them, and to obviate a possible plea that the deeds were left with them for other purposes, as indeed was contended by the appellant in his written statement, taking advantage of the non-registration of the memorandum in question.',\n",

In this case, the letter in question did not mention details of title deeds, which were to be deposited with the Bank and neither mentioned what was the principal amount borrowed or to be borrowed nor it referred to the rate of interest for the loan, the letter was not intended to be an integral part of the transaction between theparties and didnot by itself operate to create an interest in the immovable property and, therefore, it did not require registration. A-4 equitable mortgage was not created but it only confirmed the act of deposit of title deed by the appellant-defendant with the respondent-Bank and, therefore, agreeing with the lower Court, I hold that the document Ex.

Lekharam Sonaram & Co., Giridih, better secured. It was held by the Judicial Committee that the memorandum was not a document which required registration, even if the agreed advance was conditional upon it being given; and that, there being no written agreement, the memorandum as well as oral evidence, was admissible in evidence to prove the intent to create a security by deposit of the documents named. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the view of the High Court with regard to the construction of exhibit 7(a) is erroneous and the document was not intended to be an integral part of the transaction and did not, by itself, operate to create an interest in the immovable property. As the High Court has pointed out, the letter written by Sonaram--exhibit 7(b)--is not of much consequence, for it does not contain the material particulars of the loan and does not mention details of title deeds intended to be deposited with the plaintiff-bank.',\n",

A memorandum reducing other terms and conditions with regard to the deposit in the form of a document, however, shall require registration under Section 17(1)c) of the Registration Act, but in a case in which such a document does not incorporate any term and condition, it is merely evidential and does not require registration. In the face of it, we are of opinion that the charge of mortgage can be entered into revenue record in respect of mortgage by deposit of title-deeds and for that, instrument of mortgage is not necessary. By the impugned order, the High Court had directed the appellants herein to enter mutation in favour of Punjab National Bank in respect of the properties mortgaged by deposit of title-deeds.',\n",
       " \"The suit, out of which the appeal arises, was commenced by Raju Ayyar, who was a son of the testator's nephews and was taken in adoption by the widow in terms of the will; and it was for recovery of possession of certain properties, known as Kothangudi properties which formed part of the testator's estate on the allegation that under the will mentioned above, these properties were given to Nagarnmal, the wid- owed daughter of the testator for her life-time, but as there was no disposition of the remaining interest after the death of the life tenant, the properties vested in the plaintiff as the adopted son and heir of the deceased on the death of Nagammal which took place on 3rd of January, 1943. Gnanambal, the second daughter of the testator, was the first and main defendant in the suit, and she resisted the plaintiff's claim primarily on the ground that there was no intestacy as regards the suit properties after the termina- tion of the life interest of Nagammal, and that under the terms of the will itself she was entitled to get these properties in absolute right after the death of Nagammal, subject to payment of a sum of Rs. Paragraph 4 provides that if the first course is followed, that is, if the son of Gnanambal is adopted by the widow, then all the properties, movable and immovable, belonging to the testator excepting the village of Kothangudi, the house at Injigudi and the other properties which were disposed of by the will would go to such adopted son. The other is in paragraph 13, which merely says that Nagammal was to get it for life as stated in paragraph 5. 5,000 to Alamelu as has been stated by the High Court in its judgment.\",\n",

It was submitted that if the intention of the testator is to be seen in the aforesaid manner, the appellant would be the owner of the terrace above the second floor as per the Will and the Court was supposed to gather the intention of the testator from the Will, as held in Gnambal Ammal v. T. Raju Ayyar and Ors. However, in such a case, having regard to the intention of the testator to give his three sons equal share in the property as far as practicable, it cannot be assumed that he intended to give terrace rights to the two sons, who were given the second floor. No doubt, the testator did not include terrace over the second floor even in the common portion, but if the intention is to be read that omission would mean that what is not specifically stipulated, which has become an important part of the property with changed circumstances and law, was intended to be bequeathed to the three sons equally and, therefore, the tilt would be in reading the intention of the testator in that manner and not the way the appellant wants.',\n",

But all this is solely as an aid to arriving at a right construction of the will, and to ascertain the meaning of its language when used by that particular testator in that document. It will be expedient to take note of rule of interpretation in respect to construction of wills, which as held in AIR 1932 Madras 489, (Bondada) Manumallaswami and another v. Rinisetti Chinna Narayanaswami and others is to construe a will in such a manner, so as to give effect as far as possible, to all the words used by the testator, and the true way to do so would be to form an opinion apart from the decided cases and then to see whether the decided cases required any modification of that opinion, not to begin by considering how far the will in question resembles other wills upon which decisions have been given. But all this is solely as an aid to arriving at a right construction of the will, and to ascertain the meaning of its language when used by that particular testator in that document. Keeping in mind the aforesaid principles of construction of Will which is that as far as possible, effect should be given to every deposition contained in the Will unless law prevents effect being given to it and the true intention of the testator has to be gathered not by attaching importance to isolated expressions, but by reading the Will as a whole, the present Will has to be examined.',\n",

In its judgment the High Court has also pointed out the circumstances under which these account sheets, contended to be of the year 1287, were produced and the way in which they came to be noticed in the Receiver's possession. From these sheets it was sought to be argued that they contain entries in respect of the birth of the only two daughters of Govind Ballab, namely Sabitri and Indubala, and therefore Binodini could not be his natural daughter. Mr. Umrigar, following the argument of Mr. Chatterjee who argued the main points in the appeal, contended that there was a preliminary objection to the appeal being heard. When the present respondents' appeal came for hearing before the High Court, the question of maintainability was argued as a preliminary objection and the High Court held that the objection was sound but allowed the present respondents (who were appellants there) to delete the amendment made by them and gave them time to pay the requisite court-fees.\",\n",

Commissioner of Income-tax (2) (the connected appeal before us), the Bench of the Allahabad High Court agreed with the construction placed on these words in the Bombay case, i.e., the words \"annual charge\" mean a charge to secure an annual liability. Mr. Munshi, the learned counsel for the appellant con- tended that both the taxes are assessed on the annual value of the land or the building and are annual taxes, although it may be that they are collected at intervals of six months for the sake of convenience, that the income-tax itself is assessed on an annual basis, that in allowing deductions all payments made or all liabilities incurred during the previ- ous year of assessment should be allowed and that the taxes in question fell clearly within the language of section 9 (1) (iv). The learned Attorney-General, on the other hand, argued that although the taxes are assessed for the year the liability to pay them arises at the beginning of each half year and unless a notice of demand is issued and a bill presented there is no liability to pay them and that till then no charge under section 212 of the Act could possibly arise and that the liability to pay being half yearly in advance, the charge is not an annual charge. In the concluding part of his judgment the learned Chief Jus- tice said that it was not necessary for him to consider what the exact meaning of the words was and that it was suffi- cient for him to say that it did not cover municipal taxes which are made a charge on the property under section 212 of the Bombay Municipal Act. Kania J. in the above case in arriving at his conclusion was influenced by the consideration that these taxes were of a variable character, i.e., liable to be increased or re- duced under the various provisions of the Municipal Act and that the charge was in the nature of a contingent charge.',\n",
       " 'If the answer to question (ii) is in the negative whether the Ceylon immovable properties and/or the shares in Avra, Ltd., belonging to the family ceased to be the assets of the joint family after 10th February, 1947 and the income therefrom accruing thereafter required to be excluded from the assessment of the year 1947-48? In the course of his arguments the learned Counsel for the assessee could not really assail the correctness of the finding of the Tribunal, that though the shares of the three members of the quondam Hindu undivided family were defined, there was no allocation of the individual items of the immovable properties in Ceylon to each of the sharers. On the material on record the only conclusion that was possible was that the partition of the shares, which we would again stress governed the rights inter se the three members of the family, was completed even on 10th February, 1947, itself, and that there was nothing further to be done to give effect to the allocation of the shares in the books of the Company. Is the liability of the assessee to pay these Municipal rates in Ceylon an \"annual charge\" within the meaning of Section 9(1)(iv) of the Income-tax Act is the question. The learned Counsel for the assessee contended that all that the expression \"annual charge\" in its context in Section 9(1)(iv) of the Act meant was that it should be a payment or discharge of an annually recurring liability, that \"annual charge\" meant nothing more than an annual payment, and that there was no scope to restrict it further by requiring that the house property in question should be security for that payment.',\n",
       " 'Though the decision proceeded on the principle that the outgoings were not part of the assessee\\'s income at all, the framers of the amending Act of 1939 wanted, apparently, to extend the principle, so far as the assessment of property was concerned, even to cases where obligatory payments had to be made out of the assessee\\'s income from the property charged with such payments, and the second sub-clause, namely, \"where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the amount of such charge\" was added. In Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal v. Commissioner of Income-tax (2) (the connected appeal before us), the Bench of the Allahabad High Court agreed with the construction placed on these words in the Bombay case, i.e., the words \"annual charge\" mean a charge to secure an annual liability. Mr. Munshi, the learned counsel for the appellant con- tended that both the taxes are assessed on the annual value of the land or the building and are annual taxes, although it may be that they are collected at intervals of six months for the sake of convenience, that the income-tax itself is assessed on an annual basis, that in allowing deductions all payments made or all liabilities incurred during the previ- ous year of assessment should be allowed and that the taxes in question fell clearly within the language of section 9 (1) (iv). The learned Attorney-General, on the other hand, argued that although the taxes are assessed for the year the liability to pay them arises at the beginning of each half year and unless a notice of demand is issued and a bill presented there is no liability to pay them and that till then no charge under section 212 of the Act could possibly arise and that the liability to pay being half yearly in advance, the charge is not an annual charge. In the concluding part of his judgment the learned Chief Jus- tice said that it was not necessary for him to consider what the exact meaning of the words was and that it was suffi- cient for him to say that it did not cover municipal taxes which are made a charge on the property under section 212 of the Bombay Municipal Act.',\n",
       " \"On the 13th June 1950 an order was issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Sagar under the provisions of the Act for- bidding all persons residing in certain villages from engag- ing in the manufacture of bidis. On the 19th June 1950 these two petitions were presented to this Court under article 32 of the Constitution challenging the validity of the order as it prejudicially affected the petitioners' right of freedom of occupation and business. A fresh order for the ensuing agricultural season--8th October to 18th November 1950--was issued on 29th September 1950 in the same terms. Unless it is shown that there is a reason- able relation of the provisions of the Act to the purpose in view, the right of freedom of occupation and business cannot be curtailed by it. Such a prohibition on the face of it is of an arbitrary nature inasmuch as it has no relation whatsoever to the object which the legislation seeks to achieve and as such cannot be said to be a reasonable restriction on the exercise of the right.\",\n",
       " '22 and 23 of 1950. The judgment of the Court was deliv- ered by NAIK J.--The suit out of which these appeals arise was one for possession of two-thirds of the land covered by survey No. The High Court held that the plaintiffs should have filed two separate appeals within the period of limitation and as the other appeal was admittedly time-barred, the first appeal also failed by the application of the principle of res judicata. In the Lahore case, there were two cross suits about the same subject-matter, filed simultane- ously between the same parties, whereas in the present case, there was only one suit and one judgment was given by the trial court and even in the first appeal to the Sadar Ada- lat, there was only one judgment, in spite of there being two appeals by the two sets of defendants. When there is only one suit, the question of res judicata does not arise at all and in the present case, both the decrees are in the same case and based on the same judgment, and the matter decided concerns the entire suit.',\n",

(5) Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the suits were consolidated and a common Judgment was rendered on the same day and that Section 11 Civil Procedure Code is not attracted inasmuch as the Judgment in the other suit cannot be said to be anterior in point of time. Having thus referred to the previous cases, their Lordships have now clearly held as follows:- \"ALTHOUGH none of these decisions were concerned with a situation where no appeal was filed against the decision in connected suit but it appears that where an appeal arising out of connected suit is dismissed on merits the other cannot be heard, and has to be dismissed.',\n",
       " 'Your activities in the present atmosphere in Delhi where a communal riot took place on March 19, 1950 as a result of the intemperate statements made in a public meeting, are likely to create hatred between different communities which may lead to disturbance of public peace and order.\" He has argued, in the second place, that the facts of the case would establish that the order of detention is a \\'mala fide\\' order, amounting to abuse of authority vested in the District Magistrate under the Preventive Detention Act. He came to Delhi again oh the 1st of April following, with a view to attend the meetings of the two committees of the Hindu Mahasabha spoken of above, which were scheduled to be held on the 1st and 2nd of April 1950. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I must assume that the facts stated in the grounds are all true and that the petitioner did give an exaggerated version of the happenings in East Bengal at the Press Conference held on 27-3-1950, although no report of this Conference was allowed to be published under the Orders of the District Magistrate. I may also take it that there was a communal disturbance at Delhi of some magnitude on 19-3-1950 and that in these circumstances the presence of the petitioner in this city was not considered desirable; but even then a doubt legitimately arises in one\\'s mind as to the necessity or propriety of making use of the provisions of the Preventive Detention Act against the petitioner.',\n",
       " \"After the close of prosecution evidence in the Ses- sions Court, the appellant was examined under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and he denied that he had fired at Jita Singh and Dalip Singh with the gun P-16 and that Gurnam Singh had fired at Dalip Singh with a rifle. He has stated that Mohinder Singh himself was present in the court of the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, that he had signed the application (exhibit D-C) and that he was also one of the persons who had appeared before the Tehsildar when Bachittar Singh's case was called out. It seems that the learned Judges of the High Court were not at all impressed by the evidence of Dr. Goyle which they characterized as unsatisfactory and they were not also confident that the gun, exhibit P-16, had been used in causing the injuries to Dalip Singh. There is, in our opinion, a gap in the prosecu- tion evidence on a most fundamental point and the error which has been committed by the courts below is to ignore the gap and decide the case merely upon the oral evidence of 3 witnesses, two of whom are mere chance witnesses and not altogether independent persons, and the evidence of the third witness is open to criticism on the ground of his partisanship as well as the improbability of his having been able to see the firing at his brother after he had himself been shot at the back of the neck. One of the comments made by the learned Ses- sions Judge in dealing with the application alleged to have been made by the appellant on the 28th February, 1949, for a taccavi loan is that after producing the application before the Naib Tehsildar on that date, Mohinder Singh could have reached his village by noon time, but on this point the learned Sessions Judge seems to have wholly ignored the evidence of the Naib Tehsildar that he usually dealt with such applications between 12 and 4 P.M. on working days, and also the affirmative evidence of Joginder Singh.\",\n",
       " \"The learned Additional Sessions Judge was however of the opinion that even though apparently there appeared to be no reason for discarding the testimoney of the eyewitnesses, there were several circumstances in the case, especially, the medical evidence as regards the injuries on Shambboo and on Mahendra, Lal Singh and Udaibir Singh which left considerable room for reasonable doubt about the veracity of the prosecution story and that the accused were entitled to the benefit of doubt. The two main circumstances to which Mr. Chari drew our attention and to which the learned Sessions Judge also appears to have attached great weight are : (1) that while according to the witnesses the appellant was felled by them with lathies the medical evidence discloses only one injury on Shambhoo which could have been caused by a lathi and (2) the injuries received by Lal Singh, Mahendra and Udaibir Singh are not such as would be caused by Sibte's firing of which the witnesses have spoken. After a careful consideration of evidence we are unable to discover any circumstance that justifies any doubt about the truth about the 'prosecution story as against the appellant' Mr. Chari however urged that in any cast, the fact that though the pistol which the appellant fired was according to the evidence, seized from him it was not sent to the ballistic. The witnesses already mentioned have said that when Shambhoo was secured the pistol from which be had fired the fatal shot was seized from him and that one empty cartridge case was recovered from inside that pistol and 12 more cartridges were recovered from the appellant's person and that these were made over to the Sub-Inspector when he arrived. It has to be noticed that in the present case there is not only no reason to think that the injuries of which Dulla died could not have been caused by the pistol but on the contrary the nature of the injuries as shown by Dr. Nigam who held the post mortem examination is wholly consistent with the prosecution theory that a pistol was used.\",\n",

       " \"The plaintiffs, however, led some evidence to show that they purchased various machineries necessary for the mining operations of the colliery in terms of the agreement at their registered office at Calcutta to support their claim that by such purchase a part of the damages was incurred at that place within the jurisdiction of the court of the learned Subordinate Judge. The purchases of machineries, tools and equipments as also other expenses incurred as pleaded by the plaintiffs in their plaint are materials relevant for determination of the quantum of damages suffered by them which damage, if any, they suffered not really by the purchases so made or expendi'ures so incurred but by wrongful termination of the agreement by the defendant So far as the second ground assigned by the learned Subordinate Judge is concerned, it is contended by Mr. Sen that both under the terms of the agreement as also under the law, the defendant was entitled to serve the notice of termination on the plaintiffs' agent at Talcher which the defendant did on April 17, 1975, According to Mr. Sen, once such a notice of termination is served, the legal consequence thereof follows and, the agreement stood terminated on and from that date, being so effected at Talcher beyond the jurisdiction of the learned Subordinate Judge. Mr. D. K. Sen has next contended that even if it be assumed that S. R. Chandra was not authorised by the plaintiffs company in terms of Clause 54 of the agreement, yet the said S. R. Chandra being a local Manager of the plaintiff company at the colliery would be an agent of the plaintiffs within the meaning of Section 182 of the Contract Act, and as such, service of notice of termination of the contract on him would be effective from the moment of such service in terminating the agreement. In the facts of the present case according to Mr. Mukherji when before the expiry of such a reasonable time the defendant themselves served another notice on April 18, 1975, on the plaintiff at Calcutta, it should be held that the termination of the contract became effective on the service of that second notice and necessarily, therefore, such termination took effect at Calcutta within the jurisdiction of the learned Subordinate Judge. In this view, we uphold the last objection raised by Mr. Mukherji and hold that S. R. Chandra not being authorised .by the plaintiff to receive such a notice of termination and his lack of authority being known to the defendant, service on him on April 17, 1975, could not and did not terminate the agreement so that the cause of action for the present suit did not arise on the service of such a notice but arose only on the service of the notice of termination on April 18, 1975, at Calcutta within the jurisdiction of the learned Subordinate Judge.\",\n",

Counsel for the respondents, I find, rightly points out that communication of the decision actually took place in Assam, By referring to the facts that works connected with the contract were to be executed in Assam, and that records connected with the accounts were maintained by the paper Will in question located also in Assam, he says that, in any case, balance of convenience and inconvenience is against permitting the petitioners to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court, even if it is held that for mentioning the petitioners address in the impugned decision, a part of the cause of action has arisen here. The most debated question in the case is whether the writ petition should be entertained on the ground that head office of the first respondent is located within the territorial jurisdiction of this Court. Ltd. reported in (1992) 2 Cal LT 357, it has been argued that the petitioners are entitled to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court, though the decision was given by the first respondent's paper mill situated in the State of Assam. For these reasons I hold that the petitioners should not be permitted to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court for challenging the decision taken by the paper mill of the corporation situated in the State of Assam.\",\n",
       " 'The principles summarized by me in Heiza Boilers are as follows: \"Facts which have no bearing on the lis or the dispute involved in the case do not give rise to a cause of action so as to confer territorial jurisdiction on a court. Hence a fact without the proof of which a writ petition will not fail is not an integral part of the cause of action, and, accordingly, it cannot be said that a part of the cause of action has arisen at the place where the event concerning the fact has happened.\" In view of the unexceptionable principles laid down by the Supreme Court and summarized in my decision in Heiza Boilers, I am unable to agree with Mr Pal that things done in Kolkata by the petitioners for making their bid responsive and extending the bid validity period, and by NCL for verification of some documents forming part of the petitioners\\' bid and getting the bid validity extended by the petitioners are parts of the cause of action on which this petition has been brought. But a part of the cause of action in NCL\\'s failure to communicate the reasons taking place in Madhya Pradesh, is not in the automatic consequences the petitioners suffer in Kolkata, because even the fact of communication of the reasons to the petitioners in Kolkata, without anything more done by NCL in Kolkata to bring about any consequence benefiting it and at once affecting the petitioners, would not have formed a part of the cause of action that is in its decision taken in Madhya Pradesh that the petitioners\\' technical bid was not substantially responsive. As to seats of CIL, NCL through its Desk Office and Allahabad Bank in Kolkata, a place within the territories in relation to which this Court exercises jurisdiction, it is evident that none of them has anything to do with the NCL decision that the petitioners\\' technical bid was not substantially responsive.',\n",

In my opinion, no principle stated in the decisions relied on by Mr Ghosh can lead to a conclusion in this case that as the petitioners are claiming that the licence has affected them in Kolkata a part of their cause of action in the selection of the successful bidder in the tender process and grant of licence in its favour in New Delhi, has arisen in Kolkata entitling them to bring this petition before this Court on the basis of the cause of action. For these reasons, I hold that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition.\",\n",
       " '\"INTRODUCTION Whether the seat of the Parliament or the Legislature of a State would be a relevant factor for determining the territorial jurisdiction of a High Court to entertain a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India is the question involved in this appeal which arises out of a judgment and order dated 25.7.2003 passed by the High Court of Delhi in C.W.P. Cause of Action: For every action, there has to be a cause of action, if not, the plaint or the writ petition, as the case may be, shall be rejected summarily. In Union of India and Others Vs. Adani Exports Ltd. and Another [(2002) 1 SCC 567] it was held that in order to confer jurisdiction on a High Court to entertain a writ petition it must disclose that the integral facts pleaded in support of the cause of action do constitute a cause so as to empower the court to decide the dispute and the entire or a part of it arose within its jurisdiction. In view of clause 2 of Article 226 of the Constitution of India now if a part of cause of action arises outside the jurisdiction of the High Court, it would have jurisdiction to issue a writ.',\n",

Hence, in the absence of satisfactory reasons for the non-production of the evidence in the trial court, additional evidence should not be admitted in appeal as a party guilty of remissness in the lower court is not entitled to the indulgence of being allowed to give further evidence under this rule. The first appeal is a valuable right and the parties have a right to be heard both on questions of law and on facts and the judgment in the first appeal must address itself to all the issues of law and fact and decide it by giving reasons in support of the findings.

There is no quarrel with regard to the proposition of law submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the finding recorded by the civil Court is binding on the Rent Control Court. 34 In order to appreciate the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners, it is apposite to refer relevant provisions of the Act and Delhi Rent Control Act, which reads as follows: Delhi Rent Control Act 14D.

       " 'It is held on issues 1 and 2 of the plaintiff is not entitled for declaration of title and consequential relief of injunction, and so far as the additional issue on pecuniary jurisdiction is concerned, it is observed that DW1 in his evidence stated that the suit property costs of Rs.75,000/- per acre and Ex.B8 Sale Deed dated 03.08.1989, which is prior to the date of suit, refers the consideration of Rs.1,36,000/- and the plaintiff valued the suit for the plaint A schedule property is Rs.13,500/-. Court Fees & Suits Valuation Act, 1956 even as per Ex.B8, the value of property is Rs.47,500/- per acre and the plaintiff did not file any document to prove the value of suit property and from perusal of Ex.B8 Sale Deed shows the value mentioned by the plaintiff is not correct and by the time the suit filed in the year 1990 the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Junior Civil Judge Court is Rs.25,000/- and not beyond and the costs for Ac.1.33 cents is more than Rs.50,000/- worth from Ex.B8 shows on average acreage value of Rs.47,500/- and thereby, the Court has no pecuniary jurisdiction to entertain the suit and in view of the valuation of the property, the additional issue is held against the plaintiff and ultimately dismissed the suit with costs in answering issue No.3 of what result. The same is under attack in the Second Appeal with the contentions raised in the grounds of appeal including with the say of involving the substantial questions of law that the Court below ought to have seen that the suit schedule property is the self-acquired property of the father of appellant herein and the brothers of the father of appellant have no right therein, that the Court below ought to have seen that patta was granted in the name of the father of appellant in the year 1958 under the Estates Abolition Act and the suit property could not have been part of the Partition Deed-Ex.B9 dated 14.12.1930, that the Court below ought to have seen that having held that Paimash mentioned in Ex.A10-Settlement adangal is no tallying with survey number of the schedule land and erred in holding that the suit land was part of land covered by Ex.B9-Partition Deed dated 14.12.1930, that the Court below ought to have seen that the plaintiff and his brother have partitioned their properties including the suit land under the registered Partition Deed dated 27.04.1987 and there is nothing to suspect the said document, that the Court below erred in holding that under Ex.B1 the plaintiff admitted the share of defendant and even if it is taken as admitted of the only share of defendant No.1 and not otherwise, that the Court below ought to have seen that the defendants 1 and 2 colluded with defendant No.6 and brought into existence exhibits B2 to B8 and those are not binding on the plaintiff, that the Court below went wrong in holding despite defendant No.1 who went in adoption to Gurrappa Naidu since got share as the properties are family properties with a share to Gurrappa Naidu, that the Court below erred in holding that it has no pecuniary jurisdiction to try the suit despite the value mentioned in the plaint clearly speaks the pecuniary jurisdiction and having if at all to so hold went wrong in deciding the matter on merits on other issues, that too while holding no jurisdiction to try the suit. From the combined reading of the provisions also, before going further it is also necessary to refer the expression of the Apex Court in State of Karnataka v.

The petitioner firm would point out that in the petition filed in support of Crl.M.P.No.224 of 2018 the bank admitted that possession of the shed was handed over to the auction purchaser on 07.12.2017 and contend that once the auction sale concluded by delivery of physical possession of the property sold, the security interest of the bank over the mortgaged property would come to an end and Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act would no longer be available to it as the said provision is to be invoked only by a secured creditor for taking possession of a secured asset which is required to be sold or transferred. The petitioner firm would assert that the bank could have invoked Section 14 of the SARFAESI Act only before such sale, when the shed still remained a secured asset.

       " 'Rule 10 deals with determination of normal value, export price and margin of dumping and provides that an article shall be considered as being dumped if it is exported from a country or territory to India at a price less than its normal value and in such circumstances, the designated authority shall determine the normal value, export price and the margin of dumping taking into account, inter alia, the principles laid down in Annexure I to the Rules. It may be noted that under Rule 17, the designated authority is required within one year from the date of initiation of the investigation, extendable by six months in special circumstances by the Central Government, to determine as to whether or not the article under investigation is being dumped in India and submit to the Central Government its final findings as to the export price, normal value and the margin of dumping of the said article; whether import of the said article into India, in the case of imports from specified countries, causes or threatens material injury to any industry established in India or materially retards the establishment of any industry in India; a causal link, where applicable, between the dumped imports and the injury; and whether a retrospective levy is called for and if so, the reasons therefor and the date of commencement of retrospective levy. Such exports into India from Saudi Arabia were undercutting and depressing the prices of the domestic industry to a significant extent, according to it, and performance of the domestic industry during the period, January to March, 2016, was adverse in terms of profits and returns on investments. The petitioner company would also assail the finding of the designated authority that the investigation was only for examining the material injury and not for evaluating threat of injury or material retardation to domestic industry and that a reasonable duration of period is warranted for capturing the price of volume trend from Saudi Arabia so as to analyze the impact of factors other than dumped imports to exclusively establish a causal link between dumping and consequential injury. The petitioner company would point out that in terms of Rule 4(1)(c) of the Rules of 1995, the designated authority is required to submit its findings as to the injury or threat of injury to an industry established in India or material retardation to the establishment of an industry in India consequent upon the import of such article from the specified countries and therefore, the designated authority failed to live up to the statutory mandate.',\n",

In Rukia Khatun's case, the Division Bench stated that the correct law of talaq, as ordained by Holy Quran, is: (i) that 'talaq' must be for a reasonable cause; and (ii) that it must be preceded by an attempt of reconciliation between the husband and the wife by two arbiters, one chosen by the wife from her family and the other by the husband from his.\",\n",
       " 'The case of the prosecution against the two accused is that at 8.40 on the night of 28.6.1990 in village Bassi Umar Khan, near the courtyard of Atma Singh, that two accused viz, Prem Singh, accused No.1 and Deepinder Singh- accused No.2 inflicted injuries on deceased Ravinder Singh, son of Mohan Singh-PW6 and caused his death. The said tampering with the hospital record indicates that false evidence was created to prove the presence of the two alleged eyewitnesses at the time of the incident The High Court also found that evidence of recovery of the alleged weapons made on 6th July, 1990 was a fabrication as was also found by the trial court. On the question of unexplained delay in reporting the FIR to the Magistrate, it is submitted that the explanation given by the Head Constable, Kapur Singh that his vehicle had developed plug spark problem, on the way to Magistrate, ought to have been believed On the other reasoning of the High Court that as the deceased had died immediately after the assault, there was no reason to carry his body to the hospital, it is urged that it was natural for the father to have carried the body to the hospital, as he would not have known that there could have been no chance of revival of life of his son. It is argued that there was no motive nor is there evidence against him for his conviction with the aid of Section 34, IPC, Accused No.2 Deepinder Singh has been attributed to have caused one injury which is found to be only skin deep. So far as case against the co-accused-Deepinder Singh is concerned, since we have not relied on the evidence of the prosecution that the two co- accused had made a joint assault on the deceased, he cannot be convicted under Section 302 with the aid of Section 34 IPC for his alleged common intention with the co-accused Prem Singh, We thus, find no ground to interfere with the verdict of acquittal passed by the High Court in favour of both the accused.',\n",
       " '\"In the exercise of this jurisdiction the High Court can set aside or ignore the findings of fact of an inferior Court or tribunal if there was no evidence to justify such a conclusion and if no reasonable person could possibly have come to the conclusion which the Court or tribunal who has come or in other words it is a finding which was perverse in law. Subsequently, upon consideration on the factual score, the Labour Court passed an Award in favour of the Appellant herein and returned a finding on fact that the concerned workman had not completed 240 days and, therefore, the termination was held to be valid and compliance of Section 25-F was not required in terms of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act. It is against this order of the Labour Court that the High Court was approached under Article 227 of the Constitution and the latter relying upon the decision of this Court in American Express (supra) came to a conclusion that the workman in fact have completed 240 days of service and as such allowed writ petition and did set aside the award of the Labour Court with a direction that the petitioner be reinstated in service with full back wages. The proof of working for 240 days is stated to be on the employee in the event of any denial of such a factum and it is on this score that this Court in Range Forest Officer v. S.T. Filing of an affidavit is only his own statement in his favour and that cannot be regarded as sufficient evidence for any court or tribunal to come to the conclusion that a workman had, in fact, worked for 240 days in a year.',\n",
       " 'It would be seen from the above provisions that while the landlord is required to issue a notice of default, on refusal by landlord to accept rent, the tenant is required to call upon the landlord by way of a notice to specify the name of a Bank in which rent could be deposited by the tenant to the credit of the landlord. The counsel for appellant did not dispute that the tenant had not fulfilled the conditions prescribed in Section 8 of the Act before making deposit of rent in Court. The deposit which was made by the respondent in court on 29.10.1982 cannot, therefore, be regarded as a deposit made in accordance with clause (c) of sub-section (3) of Section 19-A and the appellant cannot avail of the protection of sub-section (4) of Section 19-A and he must be held to have committed default in payment of rent for the months of May 1982 to October 1982. Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1960, this Court observed that when the landlord is evading payment of rent, the tenant has to follow the procedure prescribed under Section 8 of the Act i.e. to issue notice to the landlord to name the Bank and if he does not name the Bank, the tenant has to file application before the Rent Controller for permission to deposit rent. Therefore, we are of the considered view that the eviction order passed against appellant with respect to the suit premises on the ground of default in payment of arrears of rent needs no interference.',\n",

The Commissioner of Central Excise, Delhi II however confirmed the demand holding that the factum of \"transit insurance\" by the manufacturer shows that the transaction of sale is complete only on delivery of goods to the buyer otherwise there was no good reason for the manufacturer taking responsibility of the risk involved in transportation of the goods to the buyer\\'s place. (a) the normal price thereof, that is to say the price at which such goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal, where the buyer is not a related person and the price is the sole consideration for the sale. A perusal of the orders passed by the authorities and the CEGAT show that since transit insurance was arranged by the assessee, therefore it was inferred and held that the ownership of the goods was retained by the assessee until it was delivered to the buyer on the reasoning that otherwise there would be no occasion for the seller namely, the assessee to take risk of any kind of damage to the goods during transportation. In view of the provisions of Section 23 and Section 39 of the Sale of Goods Act 1930 it was found that goods to be treated as delivered to buyer and property and possession of the goods passed on to buyer when the goods were handed over to transporter.',\n",
       " \"Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the High Court was not right in entertaining the writ petition condoning the delay and laches on the part of respondents in approaching the High court almost after a period of 17 years, that too when the acquisition proceedings had attained finality and possession also had been taken as early as on 16.10.1994 on which date the land vested with the State free from all encumbrances. It is also not in dispute that respondents 1-5 accepted/received the amount of compensation as early as on 16.10.1974 on the basis of the award passed; they sought reference under Section 18 of the Act for enhancement of the compensation and further they pursued the matter in the High Court seeking further enhancement of the compensation till 1988. In our view, in the absence of any explanation for inordinate delay and laches on the part of the respondents 1-5 in approaching the High Court, the writ petition ought to have been dismissed on this short ground, It appears that the High Court was impressed by two circumstances -(1) that even after 17 long years the respondents were not paid enhanced compensation and (2) if the acquisition proceedings are not quashed and if no direction is given to revest the land in respondents 1-5, there would be unjust enrichment by the appellant-company. Touching the question of delay and laches, in para 29, it is stated that ''it is thus well-settled law that when there is inordinate delay in filing the writ petition and when all steps taken in the acquisition proceedings have become final, the Court should be loath to quash the notifications. Merely because full enhanced compensation amount was not paid to the respondents, that itself was not a ground to condone the delay and laches, in filing the writ petition.\",\n",

This determination of tariff under the Act will have to be made in the manner provided in Section 29 of the said Act. Determination of tariff by State Commission.--(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, the tariff for intra-State transmission of electricity and the tariff for supply of electricity, grid, wholesale, bulk or retail, as the case may be, in a State (hereinafter referred to as the \"tariff\"), shall be subject to the provisions of this Act and the tariff shall be determined by the State Commission of that State in accordance with the provisions of this Act. One of the important issues which arises for our consideration in these appeals is as to the locus standi of the consumers before the Commission in its proceedings, as also before the High Court in an appeal under Section 27 of the 1998 Act. The question, therefore, for our consideration is whether the consumers have a legal right or not to be heard in the proceedings before the Commission under Section 29(2) of the 1998 Act, as also in an appeal under Section 27 of the said Act.',\n",

The condition necessary to bring the section into operation is that discovery of a fact in consequence of information received from a person accused of any offence in the custody of a Police officer must be deposed to, and thereupon so much of the information as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered may be proved.

It is the contention that the Bank followed the procedure and not violated any of the provisions or rules under the Act and there is in fact a clear 30 days gap between notices under Rule 8(6) to 9(1) of the Act and even the suit O.S.No.79 of 2011 decreed on 21.04.2014, the decree no way restrains the secured creditor Bank from proceedings under the Act, 2002 and thereby there are no merits in the writ petition and same is liable to be dismissed.

In the reply affidavit filed thereto, the petitioner asserted that, along with the Form-D application, she had filed the Form A return of estimated turnover under Rule 28(8); she had offered surety only to the extent of her sons share in the firm not exceeding Rs.8,000/-; the tax estimated in Form A was only Rs.8,000/-, and her liability as a surety was only to that extent; the Form A application, for registration under Section 7(1)/7(2) of the CST Act, is different; the Form A, as prescribed under Rule 9 of the APGST Rules, was filed estimating the tax due as Rs.8,000/-; the practice of the department is to insist on security or surety only to the extent of Rs.6,000/-; the circular issued by the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes dated 21.07.1997 makes it clear that the departmental authorities could not demand security/surety for an amount exceeding Rs.6,000/-; column 19 of the Form-D application speaks of the estimated total turnover; while security/surety can be demanded under Section 12(11), read with Rules 9 and 28(8), the surety shall not exceed the amount equal to the tax payable under the Act for the year as estimated; failure of the registering authority, to estimate the tax payable under the Act for a year, absolved the petitioner of her liability as held by this Court in R. Dandayudhapani v. Commercial Tax Officer ; while the term total turnover includes turnover which is exempt from tax, the term turnover represents the taxable turnover; Section 5 of the Act also distinguishes total turnover from turnover, and provides for levy of tax only on the latter; Form A, i.e the return of estimated turnover, makes it clear that the expression estimated turnover, in Column 19, refers to the aggregate of both taxable and non-taxable turnover; the tax estimated in Form A was only Rs.8,000/-, on the estimated taxable turnover of Rs.2,00,000/-, from out of the estimated total turnover of Rs.20,00,000/-; and the attempt by the respondent authorities to demand an amount in excess of Rs.8,000/- is contrary to law. Viswanath, Learned Counsel for the petitioner, would submit that the amount which can be collected from the surety is the tax due on the estimated turnover for the first assessment year; the meaning of the expression total turnover is different from estimated turnover; the circular of the Commissioner dated 21.07.1997, issue long prior to the assessment order and even prior to registration of the firm as a dealer, stipulated security of only Rs.8,000/-; in the absence of estimation of the turnover by the registering authority, he cannot take advantage of his own failure and subject the petitioner to tax; a security/surety bond must be strictly construed; a security/surety bond, without the required particulars, has no meaning; the respondents were not justified in recovering any amount from the surety towards the tax dues of the firm, in the absence of the firm filing Form A estimating their taxable turnover; as per clause 19 of Form D, the firm had only estimated the total turnover as Rs.20,00,000/-; the tax rate, prescribed during the relevant period, was only 4%; in any event the respondents were not justified in recovering from a surety the tax dues beyond Rs.80,000/-; and the liability of a surety is limited only to the tax due on the turnover estimated by the assessee, and not on the net turnover determined by the assessing authority. Under Section 12(7), where it appears necessary to the authority to whom an application is made under sub-section (6) so to do for the proper realisation of the tax and other dues payable under the APGST Act, or for the proper custody and use of the forms referred to in the APGST Act, the rules made and the notifications issued thereunder, he may, by order in writing and for reasons to be recorded therein, impose, as a condition for the issue of a certificate of registration, a requirement that the dealer shall furnish in the prescribed manner, and within such time as may be specified in the order, such security as may be specified for all or any of the aforesaid purposes. Viswanath, Learned Counsel for the petitioner, would submit that the surety is required to be furnished only on the estimated turnover, and not on the estimated total turnover of a dealer for the year, it is necessary to note that the prescribed Form D did not require the applicant to furnish information regarding the estimated turnover, but stipulated that they provide details of the estimated total turnover for the year.',\n",
       " 'It is seen from the amended notification that on and from 19.02.2008, the services included in S.No.6 of the table under the Schedule to the notification, would be entitled to exemption only if 4 conditions are satisfied. The main contention of the respondent/Assessee is that condition No.3 in the amended exemption notification is a mere matter of procedure and that therefore some amount of laxity can be given with regard to its compliance. In Commissioner of Central Excise v. Hari Chand Shri Gopal, heavy reliance was placed by the Assessee on the decisions of the Supreme Court in Thermax (P) Ltd., v. Collector of Customs and CCE v. J.K. Synthetics , wherein the Supreme Court held that the benefit of exemption notification cannot be denied if there has been a substantial compliance with the procedure and if the intended use of the goods for the manufacture of final product had been established. As seen from para-17 of the report, the contention of the Assessee before the Supreme Court was that the conditions stipulated in Chapter-X are only procedural in nature, warranting liberal construction and that if there was substantial compliance and if the intended use of the goods had been established, then the benefit of exemption notification cannot be denied. Therefore, the second substantial question of law is also to be answered in favour of the appellants/Revenue by holding that condition No.3 in the exemption notification at serial No.6 of the table under the schedule, is also the substance or essence of the exemption notification and the compliance with the same is mandatory.',\n",

As we have pointed out earlier, the first contention of the learned counsel for the appellant is that an Election Tribunal constituted in terms of Rule 2 of the 1995 Rules, has no power to grant any interim order, by invoking Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The second contention of the petitioner is that the disqualification prescribed in Section 153(1) of the Act is automatic and that therefore the grant of an interim order in such cases would tantamount to the restoration of a person to an office which he ceased to hold. It may be of interest to note that the provisions relating to the requirement of the elected members to obey the party whip in the matter of election of President and Vice-President of Mandal Parishad and the disqualification of persons disobeying the whip, were actually inserted by Amendment Act No.5 of 1995 with effect from 30-12-1994.

Rajasekhar, the learned Counsel for the respondent, submitted that the Regulations in general and Regulation 38 of the Service Regulations in particular, do not distinguish between an Officer who retired on reaching the age of superannuation and the one who was compulsorily retired as a measure of punishment and that in the absence of regulations making any such distinction, the respondent is entitled to the benefit of leave encashment under the first proviso to Regulation 38 of the Service Regulations.

(2) An Officer on Privilege Leave shall be entitled to full emoluments for the period of Leave. This clause, however, carved out two exceptions to the Rule of lapse of leave - the first, where an Officer retires from the Banks service, he shall be eligible to be paid a sum equivalent to the emoluments of any period not exceeding 240 days of Privilege Leave that he had accumulated; and the second, where an Officer dies while in service, his legal representatives are entitled to receive the emoluments as provided for in the first proviso.',\n",
       " \"Whereas, it is the contention of the learned counsel for the 1st respondent, who is the election petitioner, who succeeded in the lower Court, in support of the order of the lower Court and also by saying that the Rule 5 is required to read with Rule 3 of the Rules, 1995, which says an election petition should be filed within 30 days from the date of election and the deposit made by any stretch of imagination is within time and that was the observation of the learned single Judge of this Court in Maddipatla Jaganmohan Rao supra referring to the earlier Division Bench expression of this Court, which also scrutinized the expression of the Apex Court in this regard and as such the revision petition deserves to be dismissed. There are two more Single Judge expressions of this Court, (1) C.R.P.No.737 of 2014, dated 27.03.2015 in Bangaru Sankaraiah v. Talari Pothalaiah, whereby reproducing Rule 5 of the Rules 1995, it was observed in paras 5 to 9 of the judgment that as per Rule 5(1), which is mandatory to deposit by the election petitioner Rs.100/- in cash as security for costs of the petition and Sub- rule (2) has again in mandatory terms asks for dismissal of the election petition from non-compliance and thereby Rule 5 does not vest any discretion in the election Tribunal to entertain the election petition even if for any justifiable cause or reason, the petitioner shall restrain from complying with the said mandate, within the time fixed. The single Judge expression supra referring to the Division Bench of this Court in Anjamma supra is also very clear that though Rule 5 is mandatory, the compliance of Rs.100/- cash deposit is directory if it is complied with within 30 days, that is a due compliance and it it was not comply within 30 days of election, as time will not extend beyond the 30 days for presenting the election petition from the date of election, the election petition for non-compliance is liable to be dismissed. Coming to the recent Single Judge expression of this Court in Mohd.Mukhtar Ahmed v Sueed Habeeb and others by referring to the expressions of the Apex Court and this Court in M.Karunanidhi, Anjamma and Bangaru Sankaraiah supra and by referring to the Rules under Rule 4 of the Act, 1994 and Rules 3 and 5 of the Rules, 1995 supra, by mainly placed reliance upon M.Karunanidhi supra, it was observed that though the rule is mandatory regarding the amount in deposit to be made, the election petition to be filed within 15 days as per Rule 2(1) from the date of declaration of result of the election and once within that time the deposit is made, it is a sufficient compliance even instead of cash deposit, the deposit made is by way of Court fee stamps; as in M.Karunanidhi supra, instead of depositing before the High Court deposited in Reserve Bank was held a sufficient compliance, by holding to that extent the Rule is directory, though the time of deposit is mandatory and in fact, in Karunanidhi supra, Maxwell 12th edition page 314 was retied in saying an absolute enactment must be obeyed or fulfilled exactly, but it is sufficient if a directory enactment is obeyed or fulfilled substantially'. In para 10 of the Election Petition itself as referred supra, it is stated about filing of form to issue lodgment schedule form ready with money in seeking to deposit, the Tribunal did not ask to pay in cash but accorded permission to deposit, when such is the case the amount is to be deposited in to the Civil Courts deposit is into treasury, through a recognized bank and the bank in which the amount paid as per lodgment schedule and obtained challan to submit before the Tribunal was no doubt on 08.08.2013 and in between there was a day intervening, the fact here remains from the affidavit, not even find place in the original petition averments of the petitioner wanted to tender cash deposit and the Court issued the challan; with all due diligence, the petitioner could have been deposited, if on that day bank time was over, at least on the next day i.e. 07.08.201, but deposited only on 08.08.2013 for not even a case of 07.08.2013 happened to be a holiday to the bank, the fact remains even of the Rule 5 is mandatory, once the lower Court which ought to have returned the petition, if at all, it is not a cash deposit made as contemplated by Rule 5(1), neither returned nor rejected instantaneously, but for issued lodgment schedule on the self same day, that substantiates the factum of cash was chosen to tender, however, the Court issued lodgment to deposit the amount to treasury account through bank and obtain challan, as requested in the petition, the principle of law herein to be kept in mind is there is intervening act of the Court that only contributed to the delay to say for all purposes cash deposit compliance made on that date, but for at direction of Court to remit through bank challan into treasury to civil Court deposit and there the election petitioner acted as per Court directions.\",\n",
       " 'Since the plaintiff is not a coparcener, she is not entitled to claim any share in the plaint A and B schedule property. The plaintiff being unsuccessful throughout, both in trial Court and appellate court, preferred the present Second Appeal on various grounds pointing out the finding recorded by the trial Court as to the nature of the property is not in accordance with law, since the property devolved upon the 1st defendant from his father is deemed to be the ancestral property and the same is liable for partition and the plaintiff is entitled to 1/3rd share as she was unmarried by the date of commencement of Act 13 of 1986, but the trial Court and the appellate Court did not consider the nature of schedule property and acquisition of various items of the property with the income derived from the ancestral property. When the plaintiff is claiming that B schedule property was acquired by 1st defendant with the income derived from Ac.0.59 cents i.e. A schedule property, which devolved upon 1st defendant and his brother from their father, allotted to his share, it is for her to establish that 1st defendant possessed joint family property and with the income derived thereon, he purchased the B schedule property; in the absence of proof, it is difficult to hold that the B schedule property is part and parcel of coparcenary property. If the date of marriage of the plaintiff as held by both the trial Court and the appellate Court is accepted, she is not entitled to claim benefit under Section 29-A of the amended Act 13 of 1986, but taking advantage of subsequent Central Amendment to Hindu Succession Act i.e. Act 39 of 2005, she is contended that she is entitled to a share in the coparcenary property. One of the contentions raised, during hearing the appeal, by the learned counsel for the plaintiff is that if for any reason the Court holds that the plaintiff is not entitled to claim share since the plaintiff failed to establish that the suit schedule property is the self acquired property of 1st defendant, is entitled to claim benefit under Section 6 of Hindu Succession Act (amended by Central Act 39 of 2005) and she is entitled to claim share as coparcener.',\n",

In Avinash Kumar Chauhan supra the Apex Court referring to Ram Rattan, Bhaskarabhotla Padmanabhaiah, Sanjeeva Reddi, T.Bhaskar Rao and B. Rangaiah supra and other expressions including of the Apex Court in Bondar Singh vs Nihal Singh , held that Section 17 of the Indian Registration Act deals with documents, the registration of which is compulsory and Section 49 of the Act is concerned only with the effect of such non-registration of the documents which require to be registered by Section 17 of the Act or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act. But the document so tendered should be duly stamped or should comply with the requirements of Section 35 of the Stamp Act, if it is not stamped, as a document cannot be received in evidence even for collateral purpose unless it is duly stamped or stamp duty and penalty are paid under Sections 33 & 35 of the Stamp Act. In this regard even the subsequent expressions of this Court reiterated the same principle and of which in Rachakonda supra it was held that for an unstamped document even there is a total bar for its admission and no part of the document, be it-a single sentence or a word or a signature can be admitted, hence it cannot be admitted even for any collateral or other purposes unless stamp duty is levied-(impounded) and paid; whereas an unregistered document once duly stamped or stamp duty and penalty is paid, even though under section 17 of the Indian Registration Act, it is compulsorily registerable one, for collateral purpose or such other purposes specified in Sections 49 r/w 17 of the Registration Act, it can be admitted and looked into. It was further held that when the original document not duly stamped and not produced in proof, a copy of the same since cannot be an instrument and for no question of stamp duty payable thereon and further it is not at all admissible as secondary evidence even, in view of bar under Section-35 of the Stamp Act.',\n",

Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the respondents submits that the amendment can be made with retrospective effect also and by virtue of the amendment to service regulations, petitioners are not eligible to be considered to the post of Chemist. But, in the instant case, the issue that is being considered by this Court is with regard to the application of amended service rules to the vacancies already existing on the date of such amendment by holding that the amendments made to the service rules are valid and hence, the said decision is not applicable to the facts of present case. The other decision of State of Jharkhand v. Bhadey Munda relied on by the learned counsel for respondents lays down the proposition that the right to be considered for promotion is not a right to get promoted and in the absence of any existing vacancies in promotion post, it was held that a direction to the State to promote respondents was held to be unsustainable. In view of the above discussion, it is held that the amendments to the service rules under the impugned T.G.O.O.No.63/CGM(HR)/2016 dated 16.05.2016 are valid in law, but they are applicable to the vacancies arising after the said date of amendment, but not to the vacancies notified in the notification dated 23.05.2016.',\n",

By this Circular it was clarified that Section 144-C is applicable to any order which proposed to make variation in income or loss returned by an eligible assessee on or after 01-10-2009, irrespective of the assessment year to which it pertains. As per the proceedings dated 31-3-2015, a copy of which is filed by the Department itself, the DRP had time up to August, 2015 to issue directions under sub-section (5) on the objections filed by the petitioner to the draft assessment order. Therefore it is clear (1) that even as per the Tear off acknowledgment slip produced by the Department, the draft assessment order was received by the assessee only on 22-8-2014 (2) that even as per the Secretary of the DRP, Hyderabad, the time prescribed under sub-section (12) of Section 144-C, was to expire only in June or August, 2015 and (3) that therefore the stand taken by DRP, Bengaluru in its impugned communication that the jurisdiction to pass orders lapsed on 31-12-2014 was completely contrary to facts as well as law. Therefore we are of the considered view that it is possible for this Court to set aside the order of the Dispute Resolution Panel and remit the matter back to them for a consideration on merits, inspite of the fact that the period stipulated in sub-section (12) would have expired by 31-5-2015.',\n",

It is also averred that the 2nd defendant Corporation was only a parent company of 1st defendant and plaintiff thereby never an employee of 2nd defendant Corporation and never associated with 2nd defendant and plaint averments also demonstrate no privity of the contract between plaintiff and 2nd defendant, but for with 1st defendant to plaintiff and 1st defendant was taken over by 3rd defendant and there are no specific allegations against the 2nd defendant and 2nd defendant Corporation has no connection to the suit claim of plaintiff much less any privity of contract and the array as 2nd defendant in the suit is thereby unwarranted, unjust and outcome of wrong impleadment with malafide intention and there is no cause of action against the 2nd defendant by the suit claim. The operative portion of the order reads when it is not in dispute of 2nd defendant is a parent company of the erstwhile 1st defendant being its 100% subsidiary, the affairs of plaintiff and 1st defendant company have bearing on the 2nd defendant company to decide in the suit including in contention of no nexus with the affairs of the 1st defendant and its employees to the 2nd defendant and there is no misjoinder and the alleged misjoinder is a matter to be adjudicated in the suit and when the plaint specifically pleaded interconnections in the business transactions between defendant Nos.1 to 3, it has to afford an opportunity to the plaintiff to substantiate in the course of adjudication of the lis and plaint thereby cannot be rejected and it cannot be contended that there is no cause of action in the plaint much less against the 2nd defendant or the 2nd defendant array is a misjoinder and dismissed in saying the plaint cannot be rejected and the 2nd defendant array cannot be deleted from the suit. The plaint at Para 2 stated that the 1st defendant is an independent company where plaintiff had joined in service and was working and the defendant company utilised the service of plaintiff and 2nd defendant is the parent company of erstwhile 1st defendant, which was a 100% subsidiary of 2nd defendant and 3rd defendant is parent company of 1st defendant, which was taken over the information and management business unit worldwide of 2nd defendant during May 2012 and defendant Nos.4 & 5 were the employees of the 1st defendant, to whom the plaintiff was reporting at Thailand and they were made only as proforma parties. No doubt in the expression in Aruneshs case (Supra 5), the plaint against defendant Nos.1 & 2 were rejected and 3rd defendants revision application dismissed by saying 4th defendant did not file any application on the peculiar facts of that case and those facts cannot be applied to the facts here and that too there the claim was held barred by law under Order VII Rule 11 clause (d) CPC in rejecting the plaint and here, it is the alleged non-subsistence of cause of action from plaint averments and as referred supra the averments show cause of action against the 2nd defendant also.',\n",

The expression available seats is defined in Paragraph-2(a) of the Presidential Order, to mean, in relation to any course of study, the number of seats provided in that course for admission at any time after excluding those reserved for candidates from outside the State. But, it is contended by the learned Additional Advocate General appearing on behalf of the 2nd respondent University that the prescriptions contained in Paragraph-5 of the Presidential Order would apply only to the number of seats available as on the date of the bifurcation of the State, and that the seats created by the respective States after the bifurcation, would go only to the students of that State and cannot be thrown open for being filled up, simply on the basis of merit. Therefore, the contention of the learned Additional Advocate General is that after the bifurcation of the State, the entire Presidential Order will have to be applied independently to each of the two States, and that there is no question of applying the provisions of the Presidential Order to a combined State, as if both States exist together even as on date. So long as the Parliament did not think fit either to use the expression existing seats or the expression available seats as found in Paragraph-5(1) of the Presidential Order or as defined in Paragraph-2(a) of the Presidential Order, it is not open to this Court to interpret the expression existing admission quotas to mean the existing seats.',\n",

Paragraph 8 of the judgment of the Court below would show that the Court below chose to reject the plaint primarily for 3 reasons viz., (a) that the plaintiff was abrogating and subrogating and that there was no document to show Ramaiah to be the pattedar of the suit schedule land; (b) that the present suit was filed after an unsuccessful attempt by the 17th defendant to set at naught, the decree in O.S.No.101 of 1969; and (c) that the decree in O.S.No.101 of 1969 operated as res judicata. As pointed out by the Supreme Court in John Kennedy and another v. Ranjana and others , a suit for partition cannot be dismissed as vexatious on the ground that the suit property was self- acquired property. Thus it is clear from paragraphs 6 to 9 of the affidavit in support of the application for rejection of plaint that the rejection of plaint was sought on 4 grounds viz., a) absence of a cause of action; Therefore, this is not a case where there is no cause of action for the plaintiff to seek partition.',\n",

He, therefore, submits that the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the bus driver, and on due consideration of the evidence on record, decision to impose punishment of removal was made and that the disciplinary authority has taken note of all the facts before imposing the punishment. Based on the findings of the enquiry officer and the Labour Court, it cannot be said that petitioner was fully responsible for causing the accident. Therefore, it cannot be expected from a driver, when he was trying to avoid the upcoming vehicle and turning the bus towards left, that there was a stationed tractor on the road margin even though the tractor driver did not observe the basic required precautions while parking the vehicle on the road margin during night time. Guided by the principle laid down by the Supreme Court and the Division Bench of this Court referred to above, in the facts of this case, I am of the opinion that the punishment of removal be modified to that of reduction by three stages in the time scale of pay attached to the post of Driver, which would have effect of permanent forfeiture, and petitioner is not entitled to back-wages for the period of out of employment.',\n",

(5) When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be, communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order. Thus, the Constitution vests a person subjected to preventive detention with the right of making a representation against the order of detention; and, to facilitate exercise of this constitutional right, the detaining authority is required to communicate to the detenu, the grounds and the material on which the order has been made so as to afford him a fair and reasonable opportunity of making an effective representation at the earliest. In that view of the mater, the State cannot therefore seek to support the order of detention in the present case as there is utter failure of compliance with the requirement of Article 22(5) of the Constitution and thereby, the detenu was prevented from making an effective representation against his detention for the reason that he was not supplied all the material documents that were relied upon by the detaining authority in reaching its subjective satisfaction and as some of the documents supplied are not legible and as some more of the documents are in a language which is not known to the detenu and as the translated copies of such documents were not made available to him and that there was no oral explanation thereof in a language, which he knows and understands. Be it noted that considering the nature of the allegations that are made in the supporting affidavit of the wife of the detenu, particularly, the allegation that there is non application of mind, the original record, which was made available to the detaining authority and the record of the said authority was directed to be produced before this Court for perusal.',\n",

       " '\"On a plain reading of this Section, it appears that one of the conditions which has to be satisfied before a decree-holder can claim rateable distribution under this Section is that he should have applied for execution of his decree to \\'the Court\\' before the receipt of the said assets by a Court, that is, the application for execution must be pending in the Court by which the assets are received.\" A learned single judge of this Court held that such an application by one decree-holder would have been maintainable in the execution petition filed by him and not in the execution petition filed by the other decree-holder. In Kanakam Srinivasa Rao (3 supra), a learned single judge has referred to various judgments including that of a Full Bench of Hyderabad High Court in C & I Bank v. M.S.Ali Khan , which considered Section 371 of the (Hyderabad) Civil Procedure Code (3 of 1323 F), which is in pari materia with Section 73 of C.P.C., wherein it was inter alia held as under: \"All that is required under Section 371, Hyderabad C.P.C., for a rateable distribution to a decree holder is that he should have made an application to the Court for execution of the decree against the same judgment debtor and that he had not obtained satisfaction therefor.\" Apart from that, it is difficult for any decree-holder to get his decree transferred to another Court before receipt of the assets by that Court, as the other decree-holders may not be aware of the existence of such a decree in another Court, ultimately, which called for the assets of the judgment-debtor and received by it. While the preponderance of judicial opinion as discussed above is that in order to be entitled to a rateable distribution under Section 73 CPC, the decree holder must necessarily have filed execution petition and the decree has not been satisfied, a learned single judge of this Court in Jagadish Vaishnav (1 supra) took a different view by holding that non-filing of an execution petition does not deprive a decree-holder of the benefit of rateable distribution under Section 73 of C.P.C.',\n",

P.Lakshmoji Rao and Ors Learned Standing Counsel has, accordingly, submitted that the order under appeal, which was based on an order which is, ultimately, based on the judgment in P.T.Rao (1 supra), is liable to be set aside. Rao (1 supra) while holding that the High Court cannot issue a blanket direction for regularisation of the services of the employees on completion of a particular period, following the judgment of the Supreme Court in the State of Haryana Vs. Piara Singh , and while purporting to modify the orders of the learned single Judge, directed that the workmen are entitled to regularisation of their services to such post on completion of 240 working days from the date of their initial appointment. Though the learned counsel for the respondent has placed heavy reliance on the judgment in Deepali Gundu Surwase (3 supra), on the facts of this case, the said judgment have no relevance because the said case did not relate to the claim for regularisation and the issue that was considered therein related to the benefits of continuous service following the order of reinstatement. In normal course, the respondent would have been entitled to regularisation with effect from 28.8.1985 as in the cases of P.Gangaram and two others, but, he not being in service from 18.01.1985 to 29.4.1987, cannot be permitted to claim regularisation for the period during which he was not in service at all and more so, in the absence of any direction to treat him as being in continuous service by this Court in Writ Petition No.11656 of 1986.',\n",
       " 'However, the core contention of the accused is that PW3 was not present at the scene and that he is an implanted witness and that the times mentioned in the original FIR [Column No.3(b) & (c)] were manipulated to suit the tainted and false prosecution version and that the whole case of the prosecution was built up after the investigation has commenced without a first information report from any person and without the registration of the crime and that in fact after the inquest was held on the dead body of the deceased, the report was received after 03:30 P.M., that is, at about 04:00 or 04:30 P.M but, the times mentioned in the FIR and the other material documents on record were manipulated and were corrected by applying white fluid wherever necessary to cover up the blemishes and to facilitate creation of a story by implantation of some persons including PW3 as eye witnesses. Per contra, the learned Public Prosecutor would contend that there is no merit in the contentions of the defence and that PW3 and LW4, M. Sailu, the other eyewitness (not examined) witnessed the incident proper and that the lapses on the part of the investigating officer in correcting the time mentioned at Column No.3(b) & (c) in the FIR and other document in his over anxiety are not fatal in view of the direct ocular evidence and that the evidence of PW3 cannot be discarded by dubbing him as an implanted witness. When, in the report of PW1 under Exhibit P1, PW1 categorically stated about the occurrence in the presence of PW3 and another and that the alleged attack with an axe on the deceased by the alleged sole accused took place at the time when PW3, the deceased and LW4, Middela Sailu, were taking tea, there is no reason for the police officer who registered the crime to mention along with the name of the accused, the names of two other accused, Jinka Narayana and Middela Ramulu, in the Column of the FIR dealing with the names of suspects/accused. Above all, PW1 in his examination in chief categorically stated that on receiving telephonic information about the attack on his father, he went along with his family members to Banswada hospital about at 03:30 PM and that LW4, Middela Sailu, and PW3, Surampally Narayana, who were present at the hospital, informed him on his enquiry with them that the deceased, PW3 and LW4, Middela Sailu, were sitting in front of the medical shop of PW6 at about 12:00 noon and that the accused beat the deceased with an axe on the head of the deceased. Suffice to say that the prosecution version that PW3 is an eyewitness to the incident does not inspire confidence and the circumstances brought about from the material on record cast a solemn and reasonable doubt about the presence of PW3 and LW4, M. Sailu, [who was not examined] at the scene at the time of occurrence.',\n",

It was further the case of the respondents that after creation of State of Jharkhand in the year 2000, the Government decided to get the unfinished work completed either by the appellant under the agreement or by fresh contract through another agency and accordingly, a letter dated 14.03.2002 was issued to the appellant to inform as to whether the appellant was interested and willing to complete the work under the agreement and the appellant conveyed its willingness to complete the unfinished work but with certain conditions on which no consensus could be reached and ultimately, the Government took the decision to take final measurement of the work executed by the appellant vide letter dated 30.05.2003 and also published the notice in the newspapers. So far as the damages are concerned, the learned Arbitrator was of the view that the damages would be payable to the appellant because the appellant was unable to execute 33% of the work, for the reasons entirely attributable to the respondents, which lingered upto 08.07.2003 and on this score, the learned Arbitrator was of the view that the interest of justice would be served if the appellant is paid the balance of the contract amount i.e., 37% of Rs.2,62,80,786/- which comes to Rs.90,10,659/- and ultimately, the appellant was found to be entitled to a sum of Rs.2,87,75,986/- plus Rs.90,10,659/- which came to a total of Rs.3,77,86,645/- and as the appellant had already received an amount of Rs.3,18,17,831/-, the appellant was found to be entitled to a balance of Rs.59,68,814/-. So far as the damages are concerned, the learned Arbitrator was of the view that the damages would be payable to the appellant because the appellant was unable to execute 18% of the work, for the reasons entirely attributable to the respondents, which lingered upto 08.07.2003 and on this score, the learned Arbitrator was of the view that the interest of justice would be served if the appellant is paid the balance of the contract amount i.e., 18% of Rs. The learned counsel has submitted that the subject matter of dispute before the learned Arbitrator was not the entire contract and the extra work done, but it was only the remaining amount which was to be paid to the appellant on account of extra work for which no payment was made.',\n",

The learned counsels, thereafter, referred to the criminal conspiracy under Section 120B of Indian Penal Code and submitted that the Managing Director and Director of the said finance company are not facing trial and they have been declared absconder for the last 20 years and there is no agreement, direct or implied, which can be said to be proved by the prosecution in the present case to show any conspiracy with aforesaid absconding persons.

In such circumstances, a circular dated 31st December, 2018 (Annexure-5) was issued by Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs (Respondent No.-2), inter alia, providing that a dealer, who has used inputs on which compensation cess was leviable and exported goods on which there was no levy of compensation cess and where such exports have been made under Letters of Undertaking/Bonds, the said dealer would be entitled to claim refund of compensation cess by filing application in that regard in terms of the provision of Section 16 of the CGST/SGST Act and the procedure for refund, as governed under the CGST Act and corresponding Rules would be applicable. The further grievance of the petitioner is that while filing application for refund for the period 2018-19, the petitioner could have also claimed the amount of unutilized ITC towards compensation cess as refund pertaining to the financial year 2017-18, as the same was within the period of limitation, but the Petitioner was even prevented from doing so on the GSTN Portal in view of the message that the Petitioner is first required to submit its application for refund for the financial year 2017-18. After having heard the learned counsel for the parties and after considering the materials on record, this court finds that the present matter relates to claim of refund of Compensation Cess paid by the petitioner for the financial year 2017-18 and 2018-19 under the provisions of The Goods and Services Tax (Compensation of States) Act, 2017 which remained unutilized by the petitioner. It is the specific case of the petitioner that the petitioner claimed paid amount of compensation cess for the period 1st July, 2017 to December 2018 as ITC in GSTR-3B Return for the month of December, 2018, and thereafter pursuant to aforesaid Circular dated 31st December, 2018, the petitioner, on 4th March, 2019, logged in on GSTN Portal for claiming refund by filing statutory Form GST RFD- 01 towards unutilized ITC on account of compensation cess for the financial year 2017-18 but could not upload the refund application due to technical glitches.',\n",

He further submits that the petitioner has got no right to continuing in service in view of the fact that the petitioner was appointed on contractual basis. It has also to be clarified that merely because a temporary employee or a casual wage worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he would not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made permanent, merely on the strength of such continuance, if the original appointment was not made by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant rules. In view of these two judgments, even if the contention of learned senior counsel for the petitioner is accepted by the Court that the principle of nature justice is not followed and the matter is remitted back to the respondent-State, that will be futile exercise as in the case in hand, there is no possibility of any change in the decision of case on merit.',\n",

It has also come in the evidence of the informant and his mother that when the others had arrived at the place of occurrence then the accused persons fled away and it would mean that at least the other family witnesses have seen the accused persons fleeing therefore, they have named the accused persons and even recognized the accused persons before the trial court.',\n",

It was further alleged that on 30.01.1997, another Cheque No.151052 for Rs.3000/- was issued in the name of the petitioner which is mentioned at Page No.51 of the allotment register, but the petitioner by overwriting the said cheque made three to appear as thirty and illegally withdrew Rs.30,000/- instead of Rs.3000/- and thereby misappropriated Rs.27,000/-. The entry regarding the cheque is made in Ext.-2/1 i.e. the counterfoil of the said cheque, in which the amount has been said to be Rs. The argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner that there is no expert opinion on record to show that the interpolation which was made in the cheque was under the handwriting of the petitioner, is also devoid of merits as admittedly the cheques were issued to the petitioner and in his name which were encashed by the petitioner himself and the petitioner neither gave any explanation to the interpolations in the cheques in his statement under section 313 Cr.P.C.',\n",

The Central Government has been emphasizing on developing the Inland waterways transport in the country as an effective alternate and eco-friendly mode of transport and has been encouraging agencies to use the national waterways as a means of transport and for the said reason, the Member (Traffic) IWAI issued a letter to the Chief Secretary of Jharkhand on 28.07.2017 stating that the district administration should be directed to permit the petitioner to ply its vessels on NW-1 for which it had obtained valid permits from the IWAI and other concerned departments. Learned counsel for the petitioner further submits that from the objects and reasons of the Inland Waterways Authority of India (Amendment) Act, 1994, it would appear that the same is limited only to the issue of settlement of ferries and does not overlap or extend to any other power or authority of IWAI under the Act, 1985. 389 dated 14.05.2018 to the respondent no.

Learned counsel for the respondents has referred few judgments rendered by the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court to contend that a tenderer cannot challenge the decision of the respondent authorities who have right to cancel the tender if it is found to be in the interest of the respondents not to continue with the same and the High Court in exercise of its power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India has very limited scope to interfere with the decision of the tender inviting authority.

       " 'Per contra, in Punjab Beverages (supra), it is held that an order dismissing the workman contravening Section 33(2)(b) shall not be void and inoperative and hence the workman was not entitled to maintain the application for determination and payment of wages under Section 33(C)(2); a workman can proceed under Section 33(C)(2) only after the tribunal has adjudicated on a complaint under Section 33A or on a reference under Section 10 that the order of discharge or dismissal was not justified and has set aside that order and reinstated the workman; rejecting a contention that the workman would be left without any remedy on the interpretation that contravention of Section 33 does not invalidate an order of discharge or dismissal, it is stated that if the employer contravenes Section 33, he would be liable to punishment under Section 31(1) and moreover the aggrieved workman can act under Section 10 or he can make a complaint to the tribunal under Section 33A; it was held that the withdrawal of the application made under Section 33(2)(b) stands on the same footing as if no application thereunder has been made; if there was no decision on merit of the said application, it cannot be said that the approval has been refused by the Tribunal. The employer resisted the said application inter alia on the ground that the application under Section 33(2)(b) having been withdrawn, the effect of which was as if no application had been made at all; even though there was contravention of Section 33(2)(b) in not making an application seeking approval, it did not render the order of dismissal void ab initio and it was merely illegal and unless it is set aside in an appropriate proceeding taken by the employee under Section 33A or in a reference under Section 10, the Labour Court had no jurisdiction under Section 33 (C)(2) to direct payment of wages to the first respondent on the basis as if he continued in service. (iv) The contention of the workman that in the absence of approval for action taken under Section 33(2)(b), the order of dismissal was inoperative, was rejected on the ground that withdrawal of the application made for approval stood on the same footing as if no application under Section 33(2)(b) has been made at all; since there was no application made under Section 33(2)(b), the Tribunal had no occasion to apply its mind to consider whether the dismissal of workman amounted to victimization or unfair labour practice. In this view, it is not correct to say that even though where the order of discharge or dismissal is inoperative for contravention of the mandatory conditions contained in the proviso or where the approval is refused, a workman should still make a complaint under Section 33A and that the order of dismissal or discharge becomes invalid or void only when it is set aside under Section 33A and that till such time he should suffer misery of unemployment in spite of statutory protection given to him by the proviso to Section 33(2)(b). An employer by design can avoid to make an application after dismissing or discharging an employee or file it and withdraw before any order is passed on it, on its merits, to take a position that such order is not inoperative or void till it is set aside under Section 33A notwithstanding the contravention of Section 33(2)(b) proviso, driving the employee to have recourse to one or more proceeding by making a complaint under Section 33A or to raise another industrial dispute or to make a complaint under Section 31(1).',\n",

Judicial approach has to be cautious in dealing with such evidence; but the plea that such evidence should be rejected because it is partisan cannot be accepted as correct.\" It should be borne in mind that before the amendment of Section 367(5), old Code, by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act, 1955 (XXVI of 1955) which came into force on January 1, 1956, on a conviction for an offence punishable with death, if the Court sentenced the accused to any punishment other than death, the reason why sentence of death was not passed had to be stated in the judgment. Now, under Section 354(3) of the Code the normal punishment for murder is imprisonment for life and death penalty is an exception.

It is pertinent to note that before the High Court, the learned counsel for the defendant did not dispute that the defendant's title in the suit property was not proved. If after considering the matters before it, that is, the facts and circumstances as emanating from the material available on record of a given case, the court either believes that the will was duly executed by the testator or considers the existence of such fact so probable that any prudent person ought, under the circumstances of that particular case, to act upon the supposition that the will was duly executed by the testator, then the factum of execution of will shall be said to have been proved. Therefore, differing with the learned Judge of the trial court, I hold that the will has been duly propounded and the proof tendered for execution of the will and the proof of the fact that Bhagubai was having disposing state of mind at the time of the execution of the will are adequately proved in this case. This finding has been discarded in the present proceedings by all the three courts, up to the High Court, on a singular reasoning that the property in the earlier suit being a different one, the finding as to excution of the will could not be res judicata in the present proceeding though the parties are same.\",\n",

It is submitted that there is absolutely no evidence on record to show that the act of the accused driving the Tempo vehicle was in any way rash and was negligent He also contended that invoking of doctrine of Res ipsa loquitor by the Courts below is erroneous. Even otherwise, as the records of the Trial Court including the entire set of evidence has been summoned by this Court it is open for the petitioner to argue the case on merit here itself also. On perusal of the entire evidence before the Court as well as the impugned judgments, I do not find any illegality on the part of the Courts below in appreciating the entire evidence and hence see no merits in the Revision Petition and as such the same is liable to be dismissed.',\n",
       " \"Elaborating this submission, the learned Counsel pointed out that while the points referred to the Tribunal relates to the question as to whether the Corporation was justified in proposing to deduct eight days wages for each day's absence under Section 9 of the Wages Act on the dates when the workmen struck work, the Tribunal has upheld the action of the Corporation on the ground that it is permissible for the Corporation to take guidance from the provisions of Section 9 of the Wages Act; and according to him the said conclusion reached by the Tribunal was beyond the points referred to the Tribunal. It is his submission that the question whether it is permissible to deduct wages upto eight days or for a shorter period for each day's absence in addition to the deduction of wages for each day's absence, was not the question at issue in the said decision; and as a matter of fact the said question having not been considered and decided by the Supreme Court, any observation made by the Supreme Court in the said decision cannot be treated as a binding precedent required to be followed by this Court. He also pointed out that since in the notice issued to the Federation, it was specifically stated by the Corporation that the provisions underlying the Wages Act was taken into account to deduct the wages for each day's absence of the workmen, the contention of Sri Narasimhan that there is no pleading on that behalf is not correct. However, the Tribunal relying upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Kelawala, supra, has taken the view that though Section 9 of the Act has no application, applying the principle underlying Section 9 of the Wages Act, the Corporation could deduct the wages as has been done by the Corporation for each day's absence from duty on account of the strike resorted to by the workmen. So far as the second contention urged by Sri Narasimhan that the Tribunal as well as the learned Single Judge have seriously erred in law in proceeding on the basis that the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Kelawala, supra, authorises the management to deduct wages upto eight days for each day's absence in addition to the deduction of wages for the period of absence by applying the principle underlying Section 9 of the Wages Act is concerned, we find considerable force in this submission and we are of the view that the Tribunal as well as the learned Single Judge have misunderstood the principle laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Kelawala, supra, to come to the conclusion that it is permissible for the Corporation to deduct wages upto eight days for each day's absence of the employees in addition to the deduction of wages for the period of their absence.\",\n",

He also referred to us Article 297 of the Constitution of India and submitted that since all lands, minerals and other things of value underlying the ocean within the territorial waters, the continental shelf, and also the exclusive economic zone, of India is made to vest in the Union of India under Article 297 of the Constitution, the tug located on the territorial waters also must be held as being located outside the State of Karnataka. Therefore, he submits that the reading of Article 297 of the Constitution and Section 3 of the Territorial Waters Act would not support the contention of the appellant that the territorial waters abutting the landmass of a State is not a part of the State. Either the Article 297 of the Constitution or the provisions contained in Section 2, and more particularly, Section 3 of the Territorial Waters Act, strongly relied upon by Sri Narasimha Murthy, would not in any way advance the case of the appellant to support its contention that the territorial waters is not part of the State of Karnataka on the ground it vests in the Union of India. Therefore, we do not find any merit in the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant that in view of entries 25 to 27 and 30 of List I of the Seventh Schedule, on which reference has been made, it should be held that the territorial waters is a part of the Union of India.',\n",

In view of the fact that the petitioners having purchased the petition schedule premises along with other property in the year 1998 which forms a part of the sale deed dated 6-2-1947 purchased by Sundar Raj Naidu from Govindammal; consequently it was submitted by the learned Counsel appearing for the respondent that in view of these facts as narrated there is no jural relationship of landlord and tenant and consequently the Trial Court had no option but to ask the petitioner to approach the Civil Court to establish their title and then seek eviction of the respondents. Sri Janardhan, learned Counsel appearing for some of the respondents reiterating the arguments submitted that in view of the fact that in respect of the petition schedule premises proceedings were initiated under Section 19 of the old Act and they were directed to deposit the rents in H.R.C.

The State has contended that only rice and wheat meant for human consumption are exempt from tax under Schedule V and damaged wheat/rice which are unfit for human consumption cannot be considered as 'wheat / rice' or 'cereals'. As damaged wheat/rice sold by FCI is not a processed commodity, the said goods will not fall under Entry 6 of Part A of the Second Schedule, even though such damaged wheat/ rice is intended to be used as cattle/poultry feed. COMMISSIONER OF COMMERCIAL TAXES (ASSESSMENTS) HUBLI 77 (1990) STC 144, considered the question as to whether dry fish which was 'non-edible', that is not fit for human consumption but which was fit for being used as poultry feed was 'fish', which was exempted from sales under Entry 6A of V Schedule or whether it was subject to tax under Section 5(1) of the Act. We have referred to these aspects only to point out that any food grain that can be used for consumption by humans or livestock continues to retain the characteristic of a 'cereal' and is considered as a 'cereal'.\",\n",

The Deputy Commissioner has held that the claim of occupancy rights by the petitioners is in respect of 'Wakf property'. Thus by a reading of the relevant provisions of the Inams Abolition Act, 1955 and the Wakf Act, 1995, it is clear that the scope of enquiry under the Former Act where a person claims 'occupancy rights' is confined to the determination of 'tenancy rights' and not to 'ownership' of property as the State becomes the 'owner' by operation of law (See Section 3 of the Act). But, in the latter case (under the Wakf Act), the enquiry will relate to the 'title to the property' viz., 'whether the notified property is or is not a Wakf property' and not to tenancy rights. And what is more under Section 83 of the Wakf Act is, the Tribunal is not invested with the power of deciding the rights of a person claiming occupancy right; notwithstanding the property being a Wakf property still an enquiry under Section 9 of the Karnataka (Religious and Charitable) Inams Abolition Act has to be held in respect of an application filed under the said Act even though the property belongs to Wakf and it is only the Special Deputy Commissioner who is the adjudicating authority under Section 9 of the Karnataka (Religious and Charitable) Inams Abolition Act and not the Wakf Tribunal.\",\n",

(i) To declare that for the purpose of determining the value of goods for levy of entry tax under the KTEG Act, the MODVAT credit availed by an assessee on such goods is liable to be deducted. We are here really concerned with credit that has been validly taken, and its benefit is available to the manufacturer without any limitation in time or otherwise unless the manufacturer itself chooses not to use the raw material in its excisable product. Therefore, any act of the assessee subsequent to entry into local area, which may have the effect of reducing the price or cost, will have no bearing on the value of the goods on which entry tax is payable. This Court also pointed out that under the definition of \"value of goods\" in the KTEG Act, what is relevant is the purchase price at which dealer has purchased the goods; and on the other hand, as the Central Excise Act does not contemplate levy of excise duty on the excise duty component of the price of the raw material, the cost of the raw material is taken as the price less the excise duty, for purpose of levying excise duty on the intermediate/final product using such raw material.',\n",

Assuming that the Government was acting on the report of the Lok Ayukta submitted under Section 12(3) of the Lok Ayukta Act and in turn had asked the Wakf Board to initiate necessary action against the persons named by the Lok Ayukta in its report, the Wakf Board could have acted only in accordance with the statutory provisions and not independent of the same and if the report of the Lok Ayukta should be accepted at its face value and that the petitioner is a person who can be termed as a person against whom the Lok Ayukta could have submitted a report under Section 12(3) of the Act and a declaration under Section 13 of the Act, the consequences cannot be beyond what is contemplated under the Lok Ayukta Act and the Wakf Act, Petitioner at the best can be termed as a person who satisfies the definition of a public servant within the meaning of Section 2(12)(g) of the Act as he is a person who was appointed as a Mutawalli by the Wakf Board which is a statutory Board under the Wakf Act.',\n",

It is the contention on behalf of the applicants - original defendants that an opportunity is to be given by the Court to the plaintiffs and/or to the defendants (in case of counterclaim) to pay the deficient Court Fees and unless and until, such an opportunity is given, the suit and/or the counterclaim, as the case may be, cannot be dismissed and only if within a stipulated extended time as directed by the Court, the Court Fees is not paid, the suit and/or the counterclaim, as the case may be, can be dismissed. The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiffs has vehemently submitted that provisions of Order VII Rule 11 (b) & (c) would not be applicable in the facts of the present case, as in the present case it is a case of total non-payment of the Court Fees and it is not a case of deficiency in the Court Fees. At this stage, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the original plaintiffs has submitted that as in a case of total non-payment of the Court Fees, Order VII Rule 11 (b) & (c) will not be applicable and in that case, the provisions of Section 149 of the Code of Civil Procedure may be applicable, however, in that case, it is the discretion of the Court whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, time should be extended to pay the Court Fees or not.',\n",

In support of his submission, he relied on the decision reported in 2002 FAJ 490, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed in para 4 that â¬SIt is argued on behalf of the accused that mere despatch of the report is not enough and that the prosecution is further obliged to prove that the letter so despatched had reached the addressee, i.e., the accused. has observed on page 3 that SAs rightly submitted by the learned Counsel for respondents accused, the complainant Food Inspector was required to say in his evidence that the bottles were cleaned or washed either by himself or in his presence and when he has not said so, no reliance could be placed upon the analysis report. As this Court is in general agreement with the view expressed by the learned Magistrate, it is not necessary for this Court either to reiterate the evidence of the prosecution witnesses or to restate reasons given by the learned Magistrate for acquittal and in our view, expression of general agreement with the view taken by the learned Magistrate would be sufficient in the facts of the present case for not interfering with the judgment of the learned Magistrate and this is so, in view of the decisions rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Girja Nandini Devi and Ors.\",\n",

It appears that thereafter, on 31.12.1998, the State Government passed the order in the application for exemption under Section 20(1) of the ULC Act made by the land holders and the Society, petitioner No. Therefore, the action of taking over of the possession by the ULC Authority upon the form processed by the ULC Authority of Shakrabhai @ Shankersing cannot be said as binding to Galalben to the extent of taking over of the possession by making the division themselves (ULC authority) for a part of the land which was declared as excess land from the whole parcel of land bearing Survey No. 622 with the Government who is also to hold 50% interest/share in the land acquired from Shakrabhai @ Shankersing and consequently, if option is made available to Galalben whose land is not in any case declared as excess land, to choose a parcel of land as against the share of the Government in the land bearing Survey No. Further, as ordered by this Court on 04.05.1995, the allotment was only to be made and the possession was not to be handed Page 0560 over and therefore, in any event, the allottees cannot peach their case beyond the allotment and they cannot assert the possession over a particular portion of the land as of right and therefore, if such an option is made available for identifying the share of Galalben and the declaration of the land as excess/surplus land held by Shakrabhai @ Shankersing is maintained, coupled with the allotment being maintained in favour of respondent Nos.',\n",

In view of this, this Court fails to understand, if it is permissible for the plaintiff to file an independent suit why the same relief which could be prayed for in a new suit cannot be permitted to be incorporated in the pending suit by way of amendment.

After hearing the parties, the learned trial court held that in absence of a notice under Section 260 of the Act, a notice under Section 478[1]/[2] of the Act was illegal. From a fair reading and understanding of Section 260, it would clearly appear that if the erection of any building or execution of any work described in Section 254 is commenced or carried out contrary to the provisions of the rules or by-laws, then, the Commissioner, if he does not propose to take an action under Section 264, shall issue written notice, require the person Page 0472 raising construction to show cause that why such construction be not removed and if such person fails to show sufficient cause, then, the Commissioner would be entitled to pull down the said construction. A notice under Section 260[1][a] in respect of an unauthorised construction would not be unauthorised and illegal because the construction was not made by the noticee but was in existence when she purchased the premises and the expressions used in Section 260 by themselves are not quite clear, as to whether it is directed against the person who has commenced or carried out the construction contrary to the provisions of the by-laws or the rules or whether in view of the language used in Sub-clause [a] of Sub-section [1] of Section 260 namely 'has erected such building' notice could also be issued to any person other than who has actually built the unauthorised building as the power to take action against the persons who had not built the infringing construction is available when Section 260[1][a] is read in conjunction with Section 478.

It was further submitted on behalf of both the petitioners that firstly, the appellant before the Tribunal had not established as to how he was an aggrieved person so as to entitle him to challenge the order made by the Joint Charity Commissioner; secondly, even if the appellant was treated to be a person aggrieved, the appellant had failed to establish as to what was the interest that the appellant had; and lastly, the appellant had not been able to show even before the Tribunal that there was any offer for a sum higher than the one at which the property was sold and no evidence was forthcoming even in course of the hearing of the appeal that any further offers were likely or had been made by any party.

Alternatively, it was submitted that in case the Court was not inclined to uphold the order of the Tribunal the order made by the Tribunal may be set aside but the matter be restored to the original authority viz.

Under the above circumstances, the impugned order passed by the District Collector and its confirmation thereof by the State Government deserves to be quashed and set aside on the ground of delay, but while allowing the entry to be continued in the revenue record, it deserves to be clarified that the entry shall not be treated as for conferring the title in the property if otherwise not available to the transferee or successor thereafter.',\n",

On behalf of the first respondent in regard to this contention of the appellants, it is stated that even though in the notes submitted to the GOI, no comparative economics was indicated, as a matter of fact such a comparative study was taken up and it is only based on the result of such studies that the two oil fields i.e. Panna and Mukta were recommended to the GOI to be offered for development on a joint venture basis. That apart, whether the oil wells should be developed on a stand alone basis by the ONGC or not, is a matter of policy with which we are not inclined to interfere solely on the ground that there is no reference to such study in the decision of the GOI. From the material on record, it is seen that the bidders made their own survey of these wells and so far as respondent Nos.4 and 5 are concerned, they estimated the economically recoverable oil from these wells at 20 MMT while the other joint venture consortium which was short-listed along with the consortium of respondent Nos.3 to 5, had estimated it at 12 MMT, and the respective bids of the parties were evaluated on the basis of their self-evaluation of the reserve oil in the wells concerned. At any rate, when two options were available before the GOI to have a fixed royalty and cess or a varying rate based on an ad valorem rate of oil, and if after taking into consideration the entire value of the contract, the GOI has opted to go in for a fixed royalty rate, we cannot conclude that such a decision was arrived at either arbitrarily or unreasonably.',\n",

Power to examine the accused.- (1) In every inquiry or trial, for the purpose of enabling the accused personally to explain any circumstances appearing in the evidence against him, the Court- (a) may at any stage, without previously warning the accused, put such questions to him as the Court considers necessary; (b) shall, after the witnesses for the prosecution have been examined and before he is called on for his defence, question him generally on the case: Provided that in a summons-case, where the Court has dispensed with the personal attendance of the accused, it may dispense with his examination under clause (b). Dealing with the position as the Section remained in the original form under the old Code, a three Judge Bench of this Court (Fazal Ali, Mahajan and Bose, JJ) interpreted the section in Hate Singh Bhagat Singh vs. State of Madhya Bharat (AIR 1953 SC 468) that the statements of the accused recorded by committal magistrate and the Sessions Judge are intended in India to take the place of what in England and in America he would be free to state in his own way in the witness box; they have to be received in evidence and treated as evidence and be duly considered at the trial.

On the facts of the case, the learned counsel submitted that the appellant being present at the place of occurrence pursuant to an order of the Magistrate with the Police Force and was required to remove the encroachment in question and he ordered for firing when the situation went out of control, while discharging the duty of removal of encroachment and pursuant to such firing, a person died and two persons were injured, the irresistible conclusion is that the use of police force related to the performance of the official duty of the accused appellant, within the meaning of Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and consequently, without prior sanction of the competent authority, the Court could not have taken cognizance of the offence on the basis of a private complaint. SCC 41, this court had said that want of sanction under Section 197 of the Code is a prohibition against institution of the proceedings, and the applicability of the Section must be judged at the earliest stage of the proceedings and in that case, the Court directed the Magistrate to consider the question of sanction before framing a charge. can be raised and considered at any stage of the proceedings and further in considering the question whether or not sanction for prosecution was required, it is not necessary for the Court to confine itself to the allegations in the complaint, and it can take into account all the material on the record at the time when the question is raised and falls for consideration. It is not necessary for us to multiply authorities on this point and bearing in mind the ratio of the aforesaid cases and applying the same to the facts of the present case as indicated in the complaint itself, we have no hesitation to come to the conclusion that the appellant had been directed by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to be present with police force and remove the encroachment in question and in course of discharge of his duty to control the mob, when he had directed for opening of fire, it must be held that the order of opening of fire was in exercise of the power conferred upon him and the duty imposed upon him under the orders of the Magistrate and in that view of the matter the provisions of Section 197(1) applies to the facts of the present case.',\n",

As it was clear that the respondents were merely prevaricating, we concluded hearing of the appeal of the petitioner from the order of the High Court dated 18th October 1988 by which the High Court had refused to direct the respondents to pay the Rs.16 lakhs by a fixed date. As far as the question of disobedience to orders of Court is concerned, in his order dated 30th December 1985, rejecting the application of the petitioner-bank for payment of Rs.16 lakhs on the ground that it was not under the appropriate Section, the Subordinate Judge said: Money cannot lie in the Court without any specific order or contingency. Having got the amount of Rs.16 lakhs to which they were and could not, in any view of the law, have been entitled to, the respondents enjoyed the benefit of the amount for about 15 years despite orders passed by this Court on 22nd September 1986 and 12th August 1998 and it was not until this Court initiated proceedings in contempt against the respondents that the money was reimbursed in driblets by the respondents.',\n",

Act provides that the Election Petition should be filed within 45 days of the date of election and not a single day beyond that, whereas the learned Counsel for the respondent contended that Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 is applicable and the date of election of the returned candidate is to be excluded in view of the application of Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. However, the contention urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant in this case is that even if it is held that Section 9 has an application to a petition filed under Section 81(1) of the R.P. It was also contended that the filing of the application on the date of election of the returned candidate cannot be considered as a valid presentation of petition as envisaged in the section. In the instant case, the date of election of the returned candidate being 25.11.1998, the election petition filed on 12.1.1999 on exclusion of the first day from computing the period of limitation, was in time and the learned Single Judge rightly dismissed the petition filed by the appellant.',\n",

In the present case, the question of the negligence if viewed in the backdrop of the observations made by Bombay High Court it would be seen that under the statute governing distribution, transmission and generation of Electricity a duty is cast upon the Electricity Board to carry out their activities in accordance with the provision of statute namely the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, the Electricity Supply Act, 1948 and the rules framed thereunder and it was incumbent upon them to take all such steps as is reasonably expected to be done for preventing any accident which may endanger life and property of strangers or public at large. The Orissa High Court has also considered the question of negligence where death of a cyclist took place because of live electrical wire falling on the road in the case of Padma Beharilal v. OSEB, AIR 1992 Orissa 68, considering the case it was held by the Division Bench of Orissa High Court that the Electricity Board having not proved that they had taken all precautions and care were liable for the negligence. Ashraf (supra) it has to be held that the writ petition is maintainable but at the cost of repetition it may be observed that this question was considered by the Supreme Court in the case of M.S. In the present case, as the claimants have not given any basis for claiming compensation of rupees five lac, the status of the family their financial and economic condition have not been placed on record and, therefore, the safe manner in such cases would be to apply the principle laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of M.S.',\n",

At this juncture, Mr. Shroti, learned Counsel for the petitioners, has submitted that the society is engaged in public duty and once the concept of public duty is attracted, a writ petition is maintainable. The question is : when there is no statutory rules issued in that behalf, and the Institution, at the relevant time, being not in receipt of any grant-in-aid; whether the writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is not maintainable ?

The total evidence which has been collected and filed by the Investigating Agency is that the applicant Rahul Banerjee was instigating and exhorting the villagers as well as tribals for illegal cutting of trees, construction of their house encroaching upon the Government forest land and whenever authority is taking action against them they are making counter attack and assaulting the police as well as officials of other departments.

In view of the facts and circumstances as well as the material available in the charge-sheet and dicta of the Supreme Court, there is wide difference between levying of war and committing of a great riot, a rout or an unlawful assembly.

As noticed above, there is a clear mandatory in the provisions of Section 7 to the employer for payment of gratuity within time and to pay interest on the delayed payment of gratuity. Unfortunately, the Division Bench of the High Court, having found that the appellant was entitled to interest, declined to interfere with the order of the learned single Judge as regards the claim of interest on delayed payment of gratuity only on the ground that the discretion exercised by the learned single Judge could not be said to be arbitrary.

One of the grounds on which assessee was aggrieved before the Tribunal was that CIT(A) while deciding the appeal of the assessee ought not to have given direction to initiate proceedings under Section 148 of the Act against the assessee for the asst. This direction of the CIT(A) was set aside by the Tribunal by holding that there was no case made out for initiation of any proceeding under Section 148 of the IT Act in relation to the asst. It was much more so, when no reasons were assigned whatsoever as to why and under what circumstance and on what basis, this liberty is being given by the CIT(A) to the AO for initiation of the proceedings under Section 148 of the Act and that for the asst.

In our considered opinion, it is only when the taxing authorities examine the object, purpose and characteristic of scheme and the nature of amount received by the assessee in hand pursuant to such scheme, in the light of law laid down in Sahney's Steel case (supra), a finding can be recorded one way or the other as to whether it is in the nature of capital or revenue and whether assessee is entitled to get the benefit of a deduction from his total income or not. What we find by mere perusal of the impugned order of the Tribunal, which is contained in para 5 is that learned Members of the Tribunal only referred to the judgment of the Supreme Court in Sahney's case without even referring to the law laid down and taking note of the scheme in. It is only after examining the characteristic and nature of the scheme pursuant to which the assessee claimed to have received the entertainment subsidy and the law on the subject the Tribunal will record a finding on merits, as to what is the true character of the subsidy, capital or revenue?\",\n",

Again the controversy regarding starting levels was never stated on behalf of the petitioner in any of the applications submitted seeking extension of time for execution of work and this conclusion recorded by the tribunal is found to be just and proper that this ground could not have hindered the progress of the work. Lastly, in respect of escalation of wages paid, the petitioner did not submit any document nor give any other evidence in support of his claim in this regard, therefore, in the absence of any provision in the agreement providing for escalation and for delay in execution which is not attributable to the respondents, the learned tribunal is found to have rightly disallowed the petitioner's claim based on escalation of wages of labour and POL. 14,000 as security deposit, it is noted by the learned tribunal that after payment of 16th running bill on 04.03.1982 (as per Art.\",\n",

The argument of learned Counsel for the Union of India proceeds just contrary to what has been provided under Proviso 2 of Section 24 of the Act of 1971 which clearly provides that where there is any dispute as to the title to receive compensation, the matter is required to be decided by the Arbitrator, Title to receive compensation is an issue which can be joined by a person who is setting up title to compensation and title to compensation can be set up by the person who is owner of the property, khatedar tenant of the property or who is in possession of the property as mentioned in Section 23(2).\",\n",
       " \"It is also submitted that it was never the case of the petitioner that the petitioner has appointed the arbitrator and even if any application was submitted by the petitioner informing the trial Court about petitioner's appointing arbitrator then that was not pressed by the petitioner before the trial Court nor such is the case of the petitioner in this revision petition. According to learned Counsel for the respondent, the arbitrator could not have been appointed without there being demand for appointment of the arbitrator by the plaintiff-respondent and for that he never served a notice upon the petitioner-defendant as required under Sub-section (5) of Section 11 of the Act of 1996. When the parties even after the agreement providing for procedure for appointment of arbitrator fails to act or appoint the arbitrator then a petition can be filed under Sub-section (6) and (7) of Section 11 of the Act of 1996. The question in this case is only that what should be the procedure when the plaintiff- respondent filed the suit for injunction without serving a notice or without calling upon the defendant to appoint arbitrator in terms of the agreement and the defendant has submitted application under Section 8(1) of the Act of 1996; whether the trial Court has committed illegality while allowing the application under Section 8(1) of the Act of 1996 in directing the parties to get the arbitrator appointed through court by following procedure under Section 11 of the Act of 1996? The other point which was for consideration before the Hon'ble Apex Court was that who can be appointed as arbitrator and for that purpose, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that the clause in agreement stating that dispute shall be referred to arbitrator to be nominated by first party gives a right to one party to appoint the arbitrator and for such case for appointment of arbitrator, concurrence of the opposite party is not necessary.\",\n",

Usman v. Union of India (supra), while being concerned with the old Article 181 which is equivalent to Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963 also held similarly, referring to the history of amendment in Arbitration Act, 1940 and Article 158 and 178 of the old Limitation Act, 1908, that it is not possible to construe the implied reference in Article 181 of the CPC as a reference to the Arbitration Act, 1940 or to hold that Article 181 applies to application under that Act. v.

In the absence of any specific limitation under the Arbitration Act, 1940 for this purpose, there seems to be force in the submissions made by learned Counsel for the appellant that the application in the present case filed in the year 1988 i.e. on 23.11.1988 after serving a notice on the respondents for appointment of an Arbitrator was maintainable and the trial Court has erred in rejecting the said application as time barred invoking the Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963.',\n",
       " \"On facts, however, there is no dispute whatsoever, even though it may be mentioned that the respondents seek dismissal aside of this petition on the ground that the wife of the petitioner purchased a plot in the year 1992 and therefore, the petitioner would not be entitled for allotment of plot under Rajasthan Municipalities (Disposal of Urban Land) Rules, 1974 (hereinafter to be referred as 'Rules of 1974'). Mr. Singhvi learned Counsel representing the petitioner vehemently contends that the allotment of plot was made under Rule 10 read with Rule 17 of the Rules of 1974 vide which, the reservation of residential plots for allotment is made to the categorized persons therein on concessional rates. It is the contention of the learned Counsel that if for some reasons the respondent Board could not make any allotment to the petitioner of the plot earmarked to him while making reservation for him of allotment on concessional rates, the Government cannot turn around after lapse of number of years to state that the plot shall be alloted to him even though in different areas, but on current market price. It is payment of the current market price which has to be avoided while making allotment of the residential house to weaker sections of the Society and asking the petitioner to pay current market price of the plot, now earmarked for him, would certainly defeat his right of purchasing the same on concessional rate. The court is also of an independent view that in asking the petitioner to pay current market price for the plot, respondents have denied to the petitioner his right to have allotment of residential house on concessional rates under Rule 10 of the Rules of 1974.\",\n",

This Court is clearly of opinion that when it was asserted by the petitioner before the appellate authority that the notice and the order concerned were not served upon him and the persons upon whom they were served, were not the members of his family, then it was required of the appellate authority to have dealt with those submissions before pronouncing finally upon the prayer for condonation of delay. 7) that no particulars were available in the Mining Department as to who the said Vanita and Usha were, upon whom respectively the notice dated 4-3-1992 and the cancellation order dated 12-8-1992 had been served. In this case it is evident that the department is not in a position to controvert the submission of the petitioner that he was not served with the notice and cancellation order and that the ladles upon whom they were served, were not the members of his family, intentional delay in filing the appeal, as assumed by the first appellate authority, cannot be accepted; and no third party rights have come into existence which would get disturbed if delay is condoned and the appeal is heard on merits.',\n",

Mr. Bajwa, learned Counsel representing the appellant vehemently contends that once, Sunderlal had lodged the report Ex.D1 at night itself in which Mukesh was stated to have become unconscious and there was mention of dispute between the parties, Ex.P1 could not partake the character of an FIR and the same would be rather hit by the provisions contained in Section 162 of the Cr.P.C. We do not find any merit in the contention of the learned Counsel that once Sunderlal had lodged report Ex.D1 at night the same had necessarily to be treated as an FIR and further that Ex.P1 taken as an FIR would be hit by the provisions contained in Section 162 Cr.P.C.

It is evident that election to any office of the Panchayat can be called in question by filing an election petition as provided under Section 140 of the Act and the limitation prescribed for filing of the election petition is within 30 days of the declaration of the election result, which would be evident from Rule 108 of the Rules.

From the report of the Registrar General it appears that the District Judge has further reported that so far as this case is concerned except two dates no other date has been made available by the Court in Court diary. The said report of the District Judge is also placed on record, perusal whereof shows that the present Subordinate Judge III inquired into the matter and had taken out the relevant dates from the order sheet of the records of the present execution case after it has been transferred to his Court so as to compare with the Court diary and its appears that except 28.1.1997 and 16.4.1998 none of other dates are available in the Court diary.',\n",

In other words, he submitted that the authorisation in case of the appellant was executed on 11.12.1996 and the order of assessment was passed on 28.1.1998 and as such it was beyond one year from the end of the month in which the last of the authorisation for search under Section 132 was executed in the case of the appellant. The appellant did not raise this point before the assessing authority and for the first time raised this point before the Tribunal and the Tribunal has found that there was enough material in possession of the concerned authority for reason to believe that the appellant and others were in possession of the income which has not been disclosed. The last authorisation to search and seizure under Section 132 of the Act in the case of the appellant and others was issued on 11.12.1996 in respect of locker No. There is no legal bar in issuance of a common authorisation, The fact that the locker was in the name of other family members of the appellant with regard to which authorisation for search was also issued will not make any difference when the authorisation under Section 132 of the Act also contains the name of the appellant.',\n",

In view of the statement made in the counter affidavit, as referred to above, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is entitled to get consequential monetary benefit with effect from the date he was promoted, i.e. with effect from 5.5.1999 irrespective of the fact as to whether he had joined the post and whether he had worked or not. Since the petitioner was promoted to the post of Inspector of Police with effect from 5.5.1999 itself, there would be no application of Rule 58 of the Bihar Service Code and he would be entitled for consequential monetary benefit with effect from the date of promotion. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the legal propositions, as referred to above, it is held that the petitioner would be entitled for all his consequential monetary benefits with effect from 5.5.1999, the date on which he was promoted to the post of Inspector of Police.',\n",

       " 'The Maharashtra State Electricity Board has also pointed out that M/s IVR Construction Ltd. also do not satisfy all the qualifying criteria because they do not have two years experience of such work which is prescribed under the qualifying criteria. However, because the State or a public body or an agency of the State enters into such a contract, there could be, in a given case, an element of public law or public interest involved even in such a commercial transaction. e.g. A delay in commissioning a power project, as in the present case, could lead to power shortages, retardation of industrial development, hardship to the general public and substantial cost escalation. A mere difference in the prices offered by the two tenderers may or may not be decisive in deciding whether any public interest is involved in intervening in such a commercial transaction. Even if criteria can be relaxed both for-M/s Raunaq International Ltd. and M/s IVR Construction Ltd., it is clear that the offer of M/s Raunaq International Ltd. is lower and it is on this ground that the Board has accepted the offer of M/s Raunaq International Ltd. We fail-to see how the award of tender can be stayed at the instance of a party which does not fulfil the requisite criteria itself and whose offer is higher than the offer which has been accepted, It is also obvious that by stopping the performance of the contract so awarded, there is a major detriment to the public because the construction of two thermal power units, each of 210 MWs., is held up on account of this dispute.',\n",

It was, therefore, held that though the order of termination was an order simpliciter still the Court could go behind the same and further if thee foundation was the finding as to misconduct, then the order was punitive. The distinction between the earlier case and this case was that while in Ram Narayan Das\\' Case, the inquiry was made to find out if the probationer could be continued and confirmed and was, therefore, not punitive, the position in the Madan Gopal\\'s case was that the inquiry by the Settlement Officer was to find out if the employee was guilty of misconduct. (as he then was) held that it could not be as held. In Anoop Jaiswal vs. Government of India [1984 (2) SCC 369] it was held while quashing the order of termination, that it was open to the Court to go behind the order and find out if the report/recommendation of the superior authority was a camouflage and if that was the basis or foundation for the order the report/recommendation, then it should be read along with the order for the purpose of determining the true character of termination.',\n",

It is not necessary for us to quote various other sections and rules by all these provisions unmistakably show that the affairs of the appellant are controlled by the State Government though it functions as a cooperative society and it is certainly an extended arm of the State and thus an instrumentality of the State or authority as mentioned under Article 12 of the Constitution. The language of Article 226 does not admit of any limitation on the powers of High Court for the exercise of jurisdiction thereunder though by various decisions of this Court with varying and divergent views it has been held that jurisdiction under Article 226 can be exercised only when or authority, decision of which is complained, was exercising its power in the discharge of public duty and that writ is a public law remedy.',\n",

If it was known to the Enquiry Officer that they were available in Devli Khanpur, was any attempt made to contact them at Devli Khanpur or to bring them to the enquiry proceedings from that place, is not indicated by the Enquiry Officer in his report making it obvious that the factors necessary for the exercise of jurisdiction under Rule 16(3) were not present and it was not open to the Enquiry Officer to have taken recourse to this Rule to bring on record the previous statement of the complainants which allegedly was recorded by Inspector D.D.

       " 'To support the said contention, the learned counsel also drew support of certain other expressions \"inside the State\" used in Section 3(3) as well as Section 7-A(1)(b) and pointed out that if really the Legislature wanted to restrict the sale within the State alone to be excluded from the imposition of liability of tax under Section 3(4), such a specific expression would have found a place in Section 3(4) as well. According to Mr.Prasad, when Sections 3(3) and 3(4) are read together, when in Section 3(3) the specific expression used while providing concessional rate of tax of 3%, that such purchase of materials were for the purpose of \"manufactured for sale\" and such sale not being restricted within the State, the sale as defined in Section 2(n) alone would apply and in which event, even the export sale would stand excluded as provided under Section 3(4) of the Act. The learned Special Government Pleader would further contend that when such manufacturing of goods takes place, that would provide for levy of tax, in the event of it is \\'sale\\' within the State and keeping the said consequence in mind, when Section 3(4) is examined, such sale does not provide for any revenue by way of branch transfer or despatch to an agent outside the State and also in any other manner of sale taking place outside the State though not a revenue to the extent to which it could be achieved, the State would be in a position to recover at least 1% more on the value of the materials purchased by availing Form-XVII by the manufacturers. The opening set of expression contained in Section 3(4) makes it clear that after availing of concessional rate of tax under sub-section(3), if the purchasing dealer fails to perform the sale in this State but resort to other modes of disposal of such manufactured goods either by way of branch transfer or by transfer to an agent to a place outside the State for the purpose of sale except by way of interstate sale or purchase, then in those cases, levy of 1% tax on the value of the materials purchased under Section 3(3) of the Act gets attracted. When we examine the other submissions of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners that the export sale is fully covered by the definition of \\'sale\\' under Section 2(n) read along with Explanation 3(a) and thereby that is also a sale within the State, on that ground as well, no liability by way of tax can be fastened under Section 3(4) of the Act.',\n",

The petitioner states that in that Vigilance enquiry, it was found that his certificate was also a forged one and based on that, an enquiry was conducted by the TNHB and he was suspended from service on 21.03.2003 and a charge sheet was issued against him on 26.02.2004, in which, two charges were framed against him alleging that he had produced bogus transfer certificate purported to have been issued by the Corporation High School, Saidapet, thereby, he violated the Tamil Nadu Housing Board Officers and Servants Rules (hereinafter referred to as 'Rules') and Tamil Nadu Housing Board Service Regulation 36(a) (ii) of 1969 (hereinafter referred to as 'Regulation'). It was held in the Enquiry Report that the certificate issued by the Corporation School, Saidapet, is not a genuine one, but it was also stated that the Enquiry Officer had not given any reason as to how the certificate was produced to the TNHB.

In reply the learned Additional Advocate General would contend that the records of the committee for each school is available and the committee has done a thorough exercise and determined the fee and communicated to the institutions and 40% of such institutions have implemented the fee structure and the remaining 60% have given their objections, which are in the process of being considered and pending such consideration for the current academic year, the State is fully justified in directing the institutions to collect the fees fixed by the committee under Section 6(1) of the Act. It is to be noted herein that the Act while dealing with the power and functions of the committee under Section 7(1) proceeds to say that the committee shall determine the fee structure to be collected by the private schools and as per Section 7(2), the Committee has the power to require each private schools to place the proposed fee structure before the Committee and then to approve the fee structure or determine the fee which can be charged by the private schools.

The learned Single Judge went on to hold that where recourse is had to Departmental proceedings, the order of the appellate authority, against an adverse order of the Disciplinary Authority, could only be subject matter of challenge in a writ petition and that the jurisdiction of the civil court to deal with the matter of this type through a civil suit stood ousted. Rules, the jurisdiction of the civil court is ousted from dealing with an order passed by the disciplinary authority which can be questioned under the service rules and that even after recourse is had to the Departmental proceedings recourse can only be to file a writ petition is palpably erroneous.

A mere reading of Section 13 of the said Act would amply make the point clear that at the initial stage, the Magistrate was not justified in treating the respondents in this case as accused and as such, hereafter relating to applications under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, the Magistrate should not issue summons under Section 61 Cr.P.C. What is contemplated under Section 13 of the Act is a notice specifying the date etc., The endeavour should be on the part of the officer concerned is to deal with the matter gently and treating the respondents in a gentle manner and that should not be lost sight of. Simply because the application under Section 12 of the Act might refer to large number of persons as respondents, the learned Magistrate is not duty bound to issue notice to all of them and there should be application of mind on the part of the Magistrate in selecting the respondents as to whom notice should be sent, as otherwise having too many respondents before the learned Magistrate, would constitute a stumbling block for arriving at a conclusion in summary proceedings. As such, at this stage, this Court cannot simply quash the proceedings under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act on the ground that the petitioners in the Criminal Original Petition state that the allegations made in the Domestic Violence Act are all false.',\n",

Development of human capital is a national priority and it should be the endeavour of all that no deserving student is denied opportunity to pursue higher education for want of financial support. In order to consider the plea of the petitioners, it will be relevant to refer to clause 15 of the Revised Model Educational Loan Scheme For Pursuing Higher Studies in India and Abroad.

The learned Senior counsel also relied upon the judgment reported in 1998 3 CTC 165 [Nesammal and another vs. Edward and another] wherein this Court has held that the provisions of Order 7 Rule 11 are not exhaustive and the lower court should reject the plaint when the allegations reveal abuse of process of law and also relied upon the judgment reported in 2005 (5) CTC 748 [A.Sreedevi v. Vicharapu Ramakrishna Gowd] wherein this Court has held that clever drafting should not confuse the mind of the Court and the Court has to find out whether any case has been made out in the plaint and therefore submitted that lower court erred in dismissing the application in the rejection of plaint. She further submitted that the plaintiff has filed the suit for specific performance and also prayed for recovery of Rs.2 Lakhs as damages as an alternative claim and as per the judgment of this Court reported in 2006 (4) CTC 326 [Balaraman, K. Vs. Pattammal] , in a suit for specific performance, the limitation starts only when there is refusal by the other side when no period has been prescribed in the sale deed and in this case, it has been stated that in June 2005, notice has been issued calling upon the revision petitioner to execute the document and within three years, the suit is filed and therefore it cannot be contended that the suit is also barred by limitation. Though the lower court has held that the plaintiff has stated that there was an oral agreement of sale, there is no basis for the same as no pleading to that effect is stated in the plaint. As the plaint is a clear abuse of process of law, for reason stated above, the Civil Revision Petition is allowed and the Plaint in O.S.No.1 of 2006 on the file of the Sub Court, Ranipet is rejected.',\n",

The vital difference between the Model Standing Orders, as set out above, and the Draft Standing Orders, as certified by the Appellate Authority, is that while under the Model Standing Orders, a workman can be represented in the departmental proceedings by an office bearer of a Trade Union of which he is a member, he does not have this right under the Draft Standing Orders, as certified by the Appellate Authority, which restrict his right of representation by a fellow workman of his choice from amongst the employees of the appellant-Corporation. It is contended that once it was provided by the Model Standing Orders that an employee of the Corporation can be represented by an employee of another Establishment with the only restriction that he should be an office-bearer of a Trade Union, it was not open to the appellant to have made a provision in their Standing Orders that an employee of the Corporation would be represented in the disciplinary proceedings only by another employee of the Corporation.

It is the further submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioners that, as the cheques having been issued in the United States of America, drawn on a bank in the United States of America and made payable in the United States of America, the mere fact that the cheques were presented in a bank in Chennai in Tamil Nadu, India, for collection, shall not confer jurisdiction on the Judicial Magistrate exercising territorial jurisdiction over the place wherein the collecting branch of the said office is situated and that accepting the contention of the respondent court having jurisdiction over the place of the branch of the payee's bank wherein the cheques were presented for collection shall get jurisdiction to entertain the complaint against the drawer, whereas the actual place of drawal of the cheques and the place wherein the cheques were made payable are situated outside the said jurisdiction, to enable unscrupulous litigants to select a forum wherein a particular act is made punishable as an offence and the procedure makes it easy to recover money by having resort to criminal prosecution rather than civil litigation, will amount to encouraging forum shopping and also abuse of process of court. Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondent would contend that the above said contentions raised on behalf of the petitioners should be rejected as untenable for the simple reason that when a cheque issued anywhere in the the globe is presented in a branch of a bank at a place within the jurisdiction of a Judicial Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate within the State, then for the dishonour of such cheque, the said Judicial Magistrate or the Metropolitan Magistrate, shall no doubt, have jurisdiction to entertain a complaint for an offence punishable under Section 138 or under Section 138 r/w Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. It is the further submission of the learned counsel for the respondent that after the dishonour of the cheques in question, the respondent caused a notice to be issued from Chennai, mentioning his address as 37, Venkatarathinam Nagar, Adyar, Chennai-20 and since the reply notice refusing to comply with the demand made in the statutory notice was addressed to the respondent's Chennai address, the learned IX Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet does have the jurisdiction to entertain the complaint preferred by the respondent; that the summons issued by the court below in all the three cases, cannot be said to be without jurisdiction and that hence the prayer for quashing the complaints should be dismissed. In all those cases, where prosecution for an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 was sought to be instituted in a court within the jurisdiction of which the statutory notice was issued, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the court within whose jurisdiction the statutory notice originates, shall not have precedence over the place of service of notice or the place of business of the accused or the place wherein the cheque issued was payable.\",\n",
       " \"It was further submitted that the rights of the Bank to invoke Sec.14 of the Act is independent of the provisions of Sec.13(4) and the powers of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate/District Magistrate under Sec.14 is only ministerial and no adjudication is required and under Sec.14(3), the order of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate/District Magistrate is final and the same cannot be called in question in any Court or before any Authority. Observing that NPA Act provides recovery of possession by non-adjudicatory process and that if borrower is dispossessed not in accordance with the provisions of the Act in Transcore's case [(2008) 1 SCC 125], the Supreme Court held as under:- Learned counsel for 1st Respondent Bank submitted that for taking possession of the secured assets, it is open to the 1st Respondent Bank to invoke Sec.14 and for filing application under Sec.14, prior notice under Sec.13(4) is not necessary and that right of appeal/representation is available to the aggrieved person under Sec.17 of the Act as and when secured creditor decides to take possession of the property and at that stage he can also challenge the order passed by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate/District Magistrate as the case may be under Sec.14 of SARFAESI Act. The provisions of section 13(4) is available for the secured creditors to take possession of the immovable secured assets of the borrower and for that purpose, rule 8 must be followed and this rule is mandatory. In this context, we may point out that though the borrower or the guarantor would be entitled to approach the Tribunal after the proceedings of section 13(4) such a right is not available to the borrower or the guarantor in the event the secured creditor approaches the Magistrate under section 14, in the wake of specific prohibition under section 14(3) of the Act, wherein the order passed under the said provision is final and the same cannot be questioned in any court or any authority of law.\",\n",

In so far as this writ petition is concerned, it is not against the action of the second respondent bank in bringing the property for auction which is one of measures taken by the bank under section 13(4) of the Act, but only for certain relief arising out of and in the course of auction proceedings. 15.The reading of Rule 8(6) makes it very clear as to what are the relevant particulars to be furnished in the sale notice, as per which the description of the property to be sold among other particulars including the details of the encumbrances and any other thing which the authorised officer considers it material for a purchaser to know in order to judge the nature and value of the property shall be known to the secured creditor by setting out the same in the public notice. 16.Even assuming it is to be true that the encumbrance certificate is made available for inspection on 5.3.2010, the same is as rightly pointed out by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner, would not amount to strict compliance with mandatory Rule 8(6) of the Act, as per which the particulars of the encumbrance if any or any other factor which the authorised officer considers it material for an intending purchaser to be aware as referred to in Rule 8(6)(a) and (f) are to be disclosed in the public notice regarding sale. On the contrary Rule 8(6) of the Act makes it mandatory that the sale notice shall contain all the particulars including encumbrances if any and any other material factor which the authorised officer considers it material for a purchase in respect of the property as referred to in Rule 8(6)(a) and (f) and the effect of the failure to comply with such mandatory requirement is already dealt with by our Hon'ble Division Bench in the judgment reported in 2010 (4) CTC 627 wherein, our High court has held that the same is against the interest of the participants and hence, set aside the order of forfeiture.\",\n",
       " \"According to the learned senior counsel, on 7.4.2010 at the time when this Court dealt with the Miscellaneous Petition for stay, it was claimed on behalf of the State that the 8th respondent was only transferred and posted as Director General of Police and that the present stand of the 1st and 2nd respondents that the 8th respondent was duly appointed to the post of Director General of Police/Head of Police by way of selection cannot be true. It was contended that since the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Prakash Singh's case was not followed and since the application for modification as well as review was also dismissed by the Supreme Court, the only manner in which the post of Director General of Police/Head of Police could have been filled up was only by following the direction contained in para 32(ii)(i) of Prakash Singh's case and the appointment of the 8th respondent cannot be accepted as one made in compliance of the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. He would further point out that he was in the level of Director General of Police in the State by 9.9.2008 itself and that his joining as Director of National Police Academy, Hyderabad by downgrading the post to the level of Additional Director General of Police in Central service did not have any effect or affect his status as Director General of Police in this State. The learned Advocate General contended that even as per the counter affidavit of the 4th respondent Union Public Service Commission, they have expressed their inability to comply with the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Prakash Singh's case and that they have filed an Interlocutory Application before the Hon'ble Supreme Court for finalisation of modalities to be followed for the empanelment for the post of Director General of Police and in the circumstances the State Government in compliance of the orders of the Hon'ble Supreme Court formulated a procedure and issued the same by way of a Government Order in G.O.Ms.No.639 dated 26.4.2007. Insofar as the post of Director General of Police (Law and Order) as Head of the State Police, that the proceedings placed before this Court would reveal that such a procedure has been scrupulously followed in the matter of selection of the 8th respondent as Director General of Police and therefore no interference is called for.\",\n",
       " '2.The suit in C.S.No.257/2005 was instituted by respondents 1 and 2 against respondents 3 to 9 praying for a decree of declaration and injunction with respect to Technical Services and Project Consultancy and Royalty Agreements executed between respondents 1 and 2 on the one hand and the third respondent on the other. 10.In the affidavit filed in support of the application in A.No.6722/2009, it was the contention of respondents 1 and 2 that the appellants by carrying on the development of the property at Mount Road, Chennai, which was originally constructed by the third respondent with whom they have entered into a technical agreement has acted in a manner contrary to the vested rights as agreed to in the Technical Services Agreement dated 26 October 1998 and the subsequent agreements dated 12 January 2000 and 4 February 2002. According to the appellants, they were not bound by the agreement executed between respondents 1 and 2 with respondents 3 and 4 and as such, no relief could be claimed against them. The appellants having purchased the property by way of public sale without any attempt to ascertain the encumbrance, cannot be heard to say that they were not aware of the encumbrance or that they are not necessary parties to the suit, even though their principals were already parties to the suit. Since the suit is for a comprehensive relief of declaration that the agreements relating to Technical Services, Project Consultancy and Royalty are valid, legal and subsisting and are binding and enforceable on respondents 5 to 9 or its assignees, and in view of the subsequent purchase of the property by the appellants, they are necessary parties to the suit and their participation in the suit would enable the Court to adjudicate the issue in a better manner.',\n",

Shri Kapoor, learned senior counsel for the appellant vehemently contended that the executing court had no jurisdiction to go behind the decree, that the question of limitation was a mixed question of law and fact and even assuming that it was wrongly decided by the court passing the decree in terms of the award such a contention would not make the decree a nullity of without jurisdiction and hence the remand order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court was clearly unsustainable and amounted to Usurpation of jurisdiction which in execution proceedings, the Court had not got. Reliance Was placed on judgments of this Court in support of this contention which we will refer to hereafter Shri Javali, learned senior counsel for the respondent-judgment debtor on the other hand submitted that the award and decree in question appeared to have been obtained in a very curious and surreptitious manner by the appellant, that the dispute was raised within two months of advancement of loan and within a few days the entire arbitration proceedings were over, that thereafter curiously enough no attempt was made by the appellant to get the award made rule of the court and years rolled by, and when after 4 years the arbitrator was made to file the award, that attempt would naturally be at the instance of the appellant, that such late filing of the award by the arbitrator could not have been made the subject matter of proceedings before the court for passing decree in terms thereof and that the proceedings were clearly time barred and hence the award decree was a nullity. It was lastly submitted that looking to the facts and circumstances of this case, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India, this Court may not interfere with the order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court which is a remand order and which meets the ends of justice inasmuch as the correct legal position can be found out by the trial court after remand.

Learned counsel for the respondents, on the contrary, contended that since the Management had indicated to the Labour Court that it would rely upon the evidence already adduced during domestic enquiry, it was under no obligation to lead any fresh evidence but the appellant who had been contending from the beginning that proper opportunity of hearing was not given to her ought to have led her evidence once she was called upon to do so by the Labour Court. It is only when the Tribunal holds that the enquiry proceedings have not been properly held, that it derives jurisdiction to deal with the merits of the dispute and in such a case it has to consider the evidence adduced before it by the management and decide the matter on the basis of such evidence. (4) When a domestic enquiry has been held by the management and the management relies on the same, it is open to the latter to request the Tribunal to try the validity of the domestic enquiry as a preliminary issue and also ask for an opportunity to adduce evidence before the Tribunal, if the finding on the preliminary issue is against the management. In view of the above, the legal position as emerges out is that in all cases where enquiry has not been held or the enquiry has been found to be defective, the Tribunal can call upon the Management or the employer to justify the action taken against the workman and to show by fresh evidence, that the termination or dismissal order was proper.',\n",

From the above passages it is clear that the High Court has found against the contention of the first respondent that the appellant had spent for his election more than the prescribed limit for a candidate for Assembly Constituency. That apart, It is rightly pointed out by the appellant's counsel that in order to declare an election to be void under Section 100(l)(d)(iv), it is absolutely necessary for the election petitioner to plead that the result of the election insofar as it concerned there turned candidate had been materially affected by the alleged non-compliance with the provisions of the Act or of the Rules. One will search in vain for an averment in that paragraph that the appellant had spent for the election an amount exceeding the prescribed limit or that the result of the election was materially :affected by the failure of the appellant to give true and correct accounts of expenditure.\",\n",

The private person who is permitted to conduct prosecution in the Magistrate's Court can engage a counsel to do the needful in the court in his behalf.

On perusal of the order of the Magistrate, it is evident that the Magistrate has passed such an order keeping in mind, that the role of the e Assistant Public Prosecutor can not be replaced and has said 'shall act under the direction from the Public Prosecutor' thereby, the learned Magistrate has not given any liberty for the counsel to prosecute on behalf of the defacto-complainant.

That apart, It is rightly pointed out by the appellant's counsel that in order to declare an election to be void under Section 100(l)(d)(iv), it is absolutely necessary for the election petitioner to plead that the result of the election insofar as it concerned there turned candidate had been materially affected by the alleged non-compliance with the provisions of the Act or of the Rules. One will search in vain for an averment in that paragraph that the appellant had spent for the election an amount exceeding the prescribed limit or that the result of the election was materially :affected by the failure of the appellant to give true and correct accounts of expenditure.\",\n",

It has been submitted by the learned Senior Counsel for the Company that the purpose and objective for establishing of the Assam Gas Company Limited is nowhere relatable to the aforesaid subject as the Company is not at all concerned with regulation and development of oil fields and mineral oil, petroleum products resources in the State of Assam but is merely engaged in trading and transportation of natural gas as referred to above and as such, the functioning of the Assam Gas Company Limited is not at all relatable to Entry no.53 of the Union List, so as to bring within the purview of the Central Government. Mr. D.

As regards the aforesaid submission made on behalf of the Company, the Learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner contended that Article 166(3) of the Constitution of India merely lays down the power to the Governor to make rules for convenient transaction of the business of the Government of the State and the power of the State Government to frame such rules or guidelines is not traceable to the aforesaid Article but to Article 162 of the Constitution of India, but such power exercised by the State Government is subject to power of the Union to make laws under Article 73 of the Constitution of India in terms of Article 246.

In that light, it is contended that in such circumstance the participation of the respondent No.1 in the subsequent process of selection held on 04.05.2013 cannot be considered as waiver of his right so as to apply the principle of approbate and reprobate. However, in a matter relating to recruitment in service, from the decisions as relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the appellant it is clear that in the process of recruitment if any challenge to the process is to be made by any candidate, the same is required to be made without yielding and participating in the process. But in a circumstance, where the earlier process in which the candidates had appeared for examination was cancelled/annulled through the resolution dated 05.03.2013 and it was indicated that more candidates would be included as the list was to be secured from the Employment Exchange and also when it was indicated that the candidates who had already appeared in the selection examination dated 11.02.2013 shall once again appear for the examination, that itself had provided a cause of action to assail the action of the official respondents and such cause of action was available to all the candidates who had participated in the selection process dated 11.2.2013 if they had considered themselves aggrieved, since at that stage no announcement with regard to any selected candidate in any event was required to be made. Instead the respondent No.1, on making a choice has yielded to the action of the official respondents, participated in the selection process held on 04.05.2013 and in the said process when he has failed, he has approached this Court by filing the writ petition seeking continuation of the process dated 11.02.2013 which had already been cancelled and also made known to the respondent No.1 through interview notice dated 18.04.2013 though the reason indicated therein is for technical reasons.',\n",

It was also vehemently contended that the writ petitioners were not employees of the company from the inception of their entry in service but they were recruited solely for the purpose of Rihand Nagar Project and their services were terminated after the said project got closed and they could not urge for being absorbed in any other project of the company. Repelling the contentions on behalf of the Respondent company that section 25-N will-not apply because it is not a 'factory', it was held that the project in question where the writ petitioners were working at the time when two retrenchment notices were served, was a 'factory' within the meaning of Section 2(m) of the Factories Act read with Section 25-L of the Act and as admittedly, provisions of Section 25-N were not complied with in the present cases, all the retrenchment notices were null and void.

So far as the first reason which appealed to the Division Bench of the High Court in the impugned judgment for excluding the applicability of Section 25-N of the Act is concerned, it has to be noted that Section 25-O on its own language deals with the procedure for closing down an undertaking and it is for such a concern which is closed down that the proviso to sub- section (1) thereof would come into play.\",\n",

Rudra, who retired, as aforesaid, and, therefore, on his retirement the 16th vacancy arose. His claim to be promoted to the said post should have been processed in accordance with law and the said post should not have been advertised for direct recruitment This contention of the respondent was accepted by the Division Bench of the High Court by its impugned judgment dated 20th August, 1997, The High Court noted that as Dr. S.S. Shergill is already working as a Professor in the Department of Ophtalmology as a direct recruit the vacancy in the post in question must go to a promotee as there were only three promotee Professors occupying the posts of Professor in the department at the relevant time. On the contrary, it is a rule of recruitment from two different Sources, namely, in case of Professor's cadre 75% of posts had to be filled in by promotion while '25'% by direct recruitment. Consequently, the question of rotating the vacancies as posts or for treating the posts mentioned in the rules of recruitment as necessarily referable to total posts in the cadre at a given point of time in the light of .R..K. Sabharwal's judgment (supra), therefore, cannot survive for in the case of a quota rule between direct recruits and promotees the same is to be judged on the touchstone of Article 16(1) and the statutory rules governing the recruitment to the posts of Professor constituting the Punjab Medical Education Service (Class-I) and not on the basis of Article 16(4). The aforesaid decision which squarely applies to the facts of the present case, therefore, leaves no room for doubt that when under the recruitment Rule 9 in question there is no reservation of any given category of candidates like SCs, STs or BCs to the posts in the cadre of Professors, appointments to the posts in the cadre have to be made in the light of the percentage of vacancies in the posts to be filled in by promotees or direct recruits.\",\n",

The learned Single Judge while dismissing the writ petition observed that the auction notice specified a particular period namely, 1.1 95 to 31.3.98 and, therefore, the appellant could not claim that the three year period was to run as per the amended Rule 8(8)(a), that the amendment was prospective in nature and was not applicable to leases which had already been processed and rejected by the Collector earlier, - in this case on 22.3.1995, Merely because the appellate order was passed subsequent to the amendment of the rules in GOMs No. According to him the judgment of this Court in State of Tamil Nadu v. Hind Stone [1981] 2 SCR 742 was directly in point when it said that the application for grant of a lease of minerals under these rules had to be disposed of on the basis of such rules as may be in force at the time the application was disposed of and not by the rules in force at the time the application for grant of lease was made. The point for consideration is whether the appellant is entitled to a quarrying lease for sand for three years from the date of the execution of the lease date as per rule 8(8)(a) of the rules as amended by the GOMs No.235 dated 19.12.1996 or only upto 31.3.1998 as per the advertisement? Question for consideration is whether in cases where the application for lease is rejected by the Collector and an appeal is filed by the applicant before the Director, and the rules are amended during the pendency of the appeal, the above principle in Hind Stone can be applied?',\n",
       " 'J U D G M E N T PATTANAIK.J Shri Javed Abidi has filed the present Writ Petition under Article 32 of the Constitution seeking direction to the Union of India implement the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, alleging inter alia that though the Act is intended to grant opportunities to the people with disabilities for their full participation and the Act has come into operation with effect from 7.2.1996 but no effective steps are being taken for implementation of the provisions of the Act. (d) Direct the Central Government to appoint only disabled persons defined under Section 2(1) of the Act as per the provisions of Section 3(2)(I) and not to include any other person who is not a disabled person under the Act; One of the major grievance of the petitioner is that the Indian Airlines is not giving any concession to such disabled persons for their movement by air even though such concessions are being given to only blind persons, who are also disabled persons under the Act. While we agree with Mr. Sorabjee, learned Attorney General that the economic capacity is a germane consideration while deeding the question as to whether all persons suffering from disability as defined under Section 2(i) of the Act should be granted concession like blind persons for travelling by Air, at the same time we cannot ignore the true spirit and object with which the Act was enacted. We think it appropriate to direct that those suffering from the aforesaid locomotor disability to the extent of 80% and above would be entitled to the concession from the Indian Airlines for travelling by Air within the country at the same rate as has been given to those suffering from blindness on their furnishing the necessary certificate from the Chief District Medical Officer to the effect that the person concerned is suffering the disability to the extent of 80%.',\n",
       " 'Consequential amendment was made in All India Services (Death-cum- Retirement Benefits) Rules, 1958 by a notification dated May 22, 1987 whereby the pension of persons retiring after 1.1.86 was to be calculated at 50% of the basic pay in the restructured supertime scale with a ceiling on pension at Rs. However, the first respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court of Calcutta under Article 226 of the Constitution of India praying for issue of a mandamus to the Union of India and the State Government to withdraw the aforesaid notification dated 16.4.87, settle and pay the pension to the petitioner at the rate of the Rs. The contention of the appellant is that the impugned judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court is vitiated by a misunderstanding of the rule in \"Nakara\" and the overlooking of the relevant rules applicable to the writ petitioner Before adverting to the rule in Nakara, we would like to point out that the petitioner does not come within the purview of the relevant rules, as amended by the Notification dated 22nd May, 1987. That principle cannot apply in the present case where the pension benefits have been fixed on the basis of the revised pay structure to those members who are in service on 1.1.1986. In all India Reserve Bank Retired Officers Association and Ors, v. Union of India & Anr., [1992] Supp 1 SCC 664 a Bench of this Court distinguished the judgment in Nakara and pointed out that it is for the Government to fix a cut-off date, in the case of introducing a new pension scheme.',\n",

A document in cheque form on which the customer\\'s name as drawer is forged or placed without authority is not a cheque but a nullity; and, unless the banker can establish adoption or estoppel, he may not debit the customer with any payment made on it. \"A cheque drawn by a customer is in point of law a mandate to the banker to pay the amount according to the tenor of the cheque. The learned Single Judge on evidence was convinced that the signatures on the cheque were forged and it was held that the Bank Officer may be duped by the machinations of the forgerer but when it is established that the signatures on the cheque were forged it could be said that the bank has made payment on the forged cheque and for the said forged cheque there was no mandate of the plaintiff to the bank to make payment. 2 are forged it must be held that the bank has made payment on the forged cheque and for the said forged cheque there was no mandate of the plaintiff to the bank to make payment on such forged cheque.',\n",

It was also held that existence of other adequate remedies is not per se a bar to the issue of certiorari and if in a proper case it may be the duty of the superior Court to issue a writ of certiorari to correct the errors of an inferior Court or tribunal called upon to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions and not to relegate the petitioner to other legal remedies available to him and if the superior Court can in a proper case exercise its jurisdiction in favour of a petitioner who has allowed the time to appeal to expire or has not perfected his appeal e.g., by furnishing security required by the statute, should it then be laid down as an inflexible rule of law that the superior Court must deny the writ when an inferior Court or tribunal by discarding all principles of natural justice and all accepted rules of procedure arrived at a conclusion which shocks the sense of justice and fair play merely because such decision has been upheld by another inferior Court or tribunal on appeal or revision? Mr. Khaitan submitted that the order impugned although challenged before the Tribunal but the Tribunal did not adjudicate the same on merits and therefore, there is no finality and there is no merger of the order of Joint Municipal Commissioner with the order of Appellate Authority. Learned counsel further submits that at this stage, the writ court cannot interfere in the order passed by the Joint Commissioner since the writ court is not an appellate forum nor it can exercise the power of the appellate authority.

If a similar relief is to be granted to all those who were in the merit list of 1974 of I.A.S and Allied Services examination and who were placed in Class II posts because of wrong notification of vacancies in the year 1974, there would be a complete disruption in the postings and positions of persons appointed as far back as in the year 1974 who are now occupying various posts not merely in this department but in other various Allied Services as well.

The High Court allowed the appeal of Pradeep Kumar Choudhary and acquitted him because (1) his name was not disclosed as an accused till about 6.30 P.M. on that day even though the FIR was lodged at about 5.15 A.M., (2) none of the four employees of the deceased who were near the main gate was examined to prove presence of Pradeep Kumar near the gate at the time of the incident or soon thereafter, (3) the evidence of Rattan Singh the driver suffered from serious omissions and was improbable. \"As regards the identity of the assailants, it will be recalled, that it was the consistent testimony of the three eye witnesses that the lights in the factory and also in the two rooms where they were sleeping, were on at the time of the incident and it is natural also that this should be so when there were so many persons in the factory that night to assemble together for the impending election the next morning. Even though his evidence raises a strong suspicion regarding the involvement of Pradeep Kumar in the incident which led to the murder of the deceased and though Pradeep Kumar does not appear to be innocent, we do not think it proper to reverse his acquittal when undisputably the prosecution evidence as regards presence of Ratan Singh and his Maruti van in the kothi of Pradeep Kumar is inconsistent. The High Court failed to appreciate that their presence along with Krishan Kumar Jakhar and Gurvinder Singh in the factory premises of the deceased at 3.30 a.m. in the morning could not have been for any purpose other than the one which was entertained by Krishan Kumar and Gurvinder Singh, as disclosed by what happened immediately after they entered the room in which the deceased and others were sleeping.',\n",

In our view, this punishment which will involve substantial monetary loss to the appellant will meet the ends of justice and will be a sufficient corrective measure for the appellant.

       " \"In the said application, the appellant's case was that the said strike was illegal under Section 24(1)(i)(a) and (i) of the Maharashtra Act. Bhandare, learned senior counsel for the appellant contended that the Labour Court was perfectly justified in taking the view that the impugned notice dated 14th March, 11983 was not legal and valid as it violated provisions of Section 24(1)(a) of the Maharashtra Act as the said notice of strike was not in the prescribed form. He next contended that the impugned strike was also hit by Section 24(1)(i) of the Maharashtra Act as it was resorted to pursuant to the said notice, during the period in which settlement of 8th March, 1982 was in operation and the notice amongst others was based also in respect of two matters covered by the settlement, namely, Demand No.14 - Privilege Leave and Demand No. In this case, we are concerned with the short question whether the High Court was justified in setting aside the Labour Court's order declaring the strike of the workmen from 30th March, 1983 illegal as per provisions of Section 24(1)(i) and Section 24(1)(i) of the Maharashtra Act.

Whether or not the said flat and the secured asset are one and the same property cannot be concluded on the basis of the materials on record and evidence is required to be led to arrive at a proper finding in this behalf. In Debasree Das (supra), an Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court interfered with the action of the secured creditor because no valid mortgage in respect of the flat in question was found to have been created and that right under Section 13 of the Act was exercised on the basis of an agreement with two persons who never acquired any title to the said flat from its lawful owner.\",\n",

In short, the learned Single Judge accepted the award on principle that held in favour of the developer, they were entitled to specific performance however, did not grant such accepting the logic so advanced by the Arbitrator. Mr. Bachawat drew our attention to Section 14, 20 and 22 of the Specific Relief Act and contended, once Pasari would admit, he was not in possession his prayer for specific performance would be of no consequence as he did not claim possession.

It has been stated on behalf of the State that at the initial stage, the report of the sub-divisional controller was sent to the Director without the recommendation of the district controller, which prompted the Director to send the matter back to the district controller.',\n",
       " 'The grievance of the petitioner in this writ petition is that the authorities are denying the photocopies of those documents without which the petitioner is not in a position to carry on the business and to discharge its statutory duties and liabilities. The letters issued by the petitioner which are annexed to the writ petition would reveal that the petitioner sought for the photocopies of the documents, the descriptions whereof has been shown in the seizure list, and therefore, the contention of the respondents that unless the documents are specified the photocopies thereof could not be handed over, is not correct. Furthermore, the person is entitled to have the copies of the documents seized during the raid as he has to meet the proceeding that would be initiated by an authority on the basis of the documents. This Court, therefore, directs the respondents authorities to supply photocopies of the documents, descriptions whereof are given in third column of the list of documents prepared at the time of raid, within four weeks from the date of communication of this order subject to the payment of costs incurred for making photocopies thereof.

       " 'The said appeal was ultimately decided by the Municipal Building Tribunal on 15th December, 2011. Subsequently, a reference was made to the Lok Adalat at the instance of the private respondent and the said Lok Adalat proceeding which was registered as Proceeding No. The legality and/or validity of the said order of the Lok Adalat is under challenge in this writ petition at the instance of the petitioner on whose complaint the demolition proceeding was initiated. As such, this Court holds that the order which was passed by the Lok Adalat on 8th September, 2012 in Proceeding No. Thus, by relying upon the said decision, this Court holds that the Lok Adalat exceeded its jurisdiction in passing the impugned order.',\n",
       " 'Mitra, Sr. Advocate with Mr. Ratnanko Banerjee, Mr. O. P. Jhunjhunwala Ld. This application has come up for modification and/or clarification of our order dated May 6, 2013 whereby we reduced the amount of deposit from Rs.5 crore to Rs.4 crore as fixed by the learned Single Judge as condition precedent to continue in possession of premises no. \"The applicant respectfully states and submits that there is no justification in reducing the value of the property from Rs.5 crore to Rs.4 crore and on the contrary, there is every justification for enhancement of the amount that is required to be paid by the appellant for purchase of the property.\" Mr. Jayanta Kumar Mitra, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant, argued before us, there could not be any scope for the learned Judge to impose a condition as they were the lawful tenants in respect of the property in question since 1958 much prior to the order of liquidation. We once again make it clear, the deposit of Rs.5 crore as directed by the learned Single Judge was reduced by us to Rs.4 crore that would have no bearing at all on the price of the property for which the Official Liquidator would be asked to conclude the sale.',\n",
       " 'Considering the averments contained in the application for condonation of delay, we are satisfied that substantial part of the delay has occurred due to failure on the part of the learned advocate for the appellant to take steps. There was no justification on the part of the learned advocate for the appellant to advise the appellant to file the appeal without the certified copy of the judgment. Since we are convinced that there is no malafide involved in non-filing of the judgment together with memorandum of appeal and we are satisfied with the explanations offered in the application and in the supplementary affidavit, we allow the application for condonation of delay and condone the delay in filing the appeal. The appellant is directed to put in requisite for effecting service of the notice of the appeal upon the respondent. The appellant is directed to prepare and file requisite number of informal paper books, printed, typewritten or cyclostyled, as the case may be, within two months from the date of service of notice of arrival of the records on the learned advocate for the appellant.',\n",
